Abstract

The ∼500 thousand year old stratum 4a lithic assemblage from Kathu Pan 1, Northern Cape, South Africa, is one of the earliest occurrences of blade technology and is the oldest dated assemblage attributed to the Fauresmith industry. A technological analysis of the Kathu Pan 1 stratum 4a assemblage reveals that blades were systematically removed using direct hard hammer percussion from organized blade cores that were extensively prepared via centripetal flaking. Some of these blades were retouched into points. Comparisons with published descriptions of the roughly contemporary blade assemblages from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya and Qesem Cave, Israel demonstrate that diverse blade production strategies were employed during the earlier half of the Middle Pleistocene. The diversity best supports a scenario in which laminar technology was invented in multiple places and times.

1. Introduction

Despite a common perception in secondary literature that blade production is uniquely associated with Homo sapiens and that systematic blade production confers an adaptive advantage over prepared core flake production, most research presents a far more complex picture for the origins and significance of blades. Blades characterize Upper Paleolithic and Later Stone Age assemblages after 50 thousand years ago (ka), but are also a common component in many Middle Palaeolithic and Middle Stone Age (MSA) assemblages ∼300–50 ka (e.g. Bar-Yosef and Kuhn, 1999 ; Delagnes and Meignen, 2006 ; Mellars, 1973 ; White, 1982 ; for the MSA see Morgan and Renne, 2008 ; Thompson et al., 2010 ; Wurz, 2000 , 2002 ; Soriano et al., 2007 ; Van Peer, 1992 ; Villa et al., 2010 ). Strong evidence for blade production securely dated to the earlier part of the Middle Pleistocene (>350 ka) is currently emerging in the Levant, East Africa, and South Africa. In the Levant, the earliest appearance of the laminar Amudian industry has been dated to between ∼420 and 320 ka at the site of Qesem Cave ( Gopher et al., 2010 ). In East Africa, the earliest occurrence of blades and blade cores date to at least 509 ± 9 ka in the Kapthurin Formation ( Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ). In southern Africa, a laminar industry from the site of Kathu Pan 1 (KP1) has been dated by OSL to 464 ± 47 ka ( Porat et al., 2010 ).

The capacity for blade production is just one aspect of evolutionary change now dated the early half of the Middle Pleistocene between ∼780–350 ka. This period was witness to other technological shifts, including the appearance and proliferation of prepared core reduction strategies ( Beaumont and Vogel, 2006 ; Goren-Inbar, 1996 ; Kuman, 2001 ; McBrearty, 1991 ; McNabb, 2001 ; Ronen, 2006 ; Volman, 1984 ) and potentially, soft hammer percussion ( Clark, 2001 :14). The appearance of what has been termed ‘regional traditions’ ( Clark, 1977 ; McBrearty and Brooks, 2000 ) might also originate in the early Middle Pleistocene; the Sangoan and the Fauresmith have been argued to reflect two regionally limited industries in southern Africa contemporary with or just subsequent to the late ESA ( Clark, 1959 : 144–153). These technological and behavioral shifts roughly correlate with the appearance of Homo heidelbergensis sensu lato ( Rightmire, 2001 ) and increases in cranial capacity ( Ruff et al., 1997 ). Furthermore, there may be a correlation of these technological and morphological changes with a trend toward increasing climatic instability. Approximately 500 ka substantial and frequent climatic fluctuations may have generated increased selective pressures for behavioral adaptability – the capacity to modify behaviors in response to changing local environments ( Potts, 1998 ). It has been suggested that new technologies in the Middle Pleistocene signal increased diversification and innovativeness in the technological behavior of some hominin groups (eg. Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ; Tryon et al., 2005 ), which may be indicative of new capacities for flexible adaptive responses to changing local environments. We are now in a position to consider the diversity of blade technology in the early Middle Pleistocene and to consider whether the initial appearance of laminar production spread from a single center of innovation or was a strategy developed independently by different hominin populations.

This paper presents the first detailed description and technological analysis of the ∼500 thousand year old laminar assemblage from KP1. The assemblage has been designated as Fauresmith, which is variably attributed to a final phase of the Late Earlier Stone Age (ESA, Klein, 2000 ; Sampson, 1974 ) or the early MSA ( Beaumont, 1990a ; Beaumont and Vogel, 2006 ; Herries, 2011 ). Here it is demonstrated that blades were systematically manufactured from highly-prepared cores. Platforms and their adjacent dorsal surfaces were usually prepared prior to the detachment of blades using direct hard hammer percussion, and the resulting laminar end products were retouched into a variety of forms that included unifacially retouched points.

To address the question of diversity and innovation in the early Middle Pleistocene, the KP1 laminar industry is compared with published data for the blade assemblages of similar age from the Kapthurin Formation, East Africa ( Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ) and the Amudian industry as represented at Qesem Cave ( Barkai et al., 2009 ; Shimelmitz, 2009 ; Shimelmitz et al., 2011 ). Here, we identify aspects of blade production at KP1 that may be related to learned technological behaviors and are clearly distinct from blade production in East Africa and the Levant. The results of this comparative study underscore the diversity of early blade technologies and best support a multiple origins hypothesis for the practice of blade production.
2. Kathu Pan 1 (KP1)

KP1 is located in central South Africa in the Northern Cape Province ( Fig. 1 ). The site is one of eleven localities in Kathu Pan ( Fig. 2 ) that were excavated between 1978 and 1990 by Peter Beaumont ( Beaumont, 1990b , 2004 ). The pan is a shallow depression with internal drainage and high water table, covering an area of about 0.3 km 2 . Seven of the Kathu Pan sites, including KP1, are in-filled sinkholes that formed within calcretes of the Tertiary-aged Kalahari Group. KP1 preserves the longest lithostratigraphic and archeological sequence of the sites, documenting a history of human occupation at the pan through the ESA, MSA, and Later Stone Age ( Table 1 ). The fauna from KP1 were first studied by Klein ( Klein, 1988 ).

2.1. Stratigraphy and chronology

Recent investigations by Porat et al. (2010) were able to confirm many of the stratigraphic observations reported by Beaumont (1990b , 2004) and report secure age estimates for strata 2–4 ( Fig. 3 ). Stratum 3 bears an MSA assemblage, stratum 4a bears the Fauresmith-designated laminar assemblage described here, and the underlying stratum 4b bears an Acheulean assemblage. In stratum 4a, artifacts are accumulated in sandy vents, and sediment samples from inside one of the vents gave a minimum OSL age of 464 ± 47 ka. An independent combined U-series/ESR analysis of tooth excavated in situ from inside the same vent gives an age estimate of 542 + 140/−107 ka. The overlying stratum 3 provides additional chronological control with an OSL age estimate of 291 ± 45 ka.

The Fauresmith industry was identified in stratum 4a based on the co-occurrence of Levallois points and handaxes ( Beaumont and Vogel, 2006 : 224), and prepared cores, blades, and ‘side-scrapers on flakes’ ( Beaumont, 1990b :79). The Fauresmith as an industry remains poorly defined ( Underhill, 2011 ) and besides KP1, there are few well-dated contexts ( Herries, 2011 ). However, regardless of whether or not the Fauresmith, and the designation of stratum 4a at KP1 as such, is valid or not, the KP1 assemblage reflects hominin technological behaviors at Kathu Pan ∼500 ka and has the potential to shed light on early blade production.

The 4a lithic assemblage is not the result of mixing of the overlying MSA stratum 3 with the underlying Acheulean stratum 4b. The artifacts in stratum 3 are heavily rolled and suggestive of higher-energy water transport, whereas the artifacts in Stratum 4a are patinated, but the edges are in fresh condition. Furthermore, there is a clear difference between stratum 3 and 4 sediments. Stratum 3 is gravel with grey silty sand matrix, and Stratum 4 is light brown to pink sand ( Fig. 3 ). The vertically-oriented sandy vents at the top of stratum 4a are cut-off at the top by the stratum 3 deposit. Also, tool type frequencies between the three strata differ greatly ( Fig. 4 ). Blades are extremely rare in the stratum 3 MSA assemblage, but abundant in the stratum 4a Fauresmith assemblage. Bifaces are extremely rare in the stratum 4a assemblage, but abundant in the stratum 4b assemblage.

The relationship between stratum 4a and 4b is less clear cut, however. A sediment change between stratum 4a and 4b is not distinct, but artifact frequencies differ between 4a and 4b ( Fig. 4 ); bifaces are abundant and blades are nearly absent in stratum 4b. The vertical distribution in Stratum 4a reveals that bifaces within in this stratum only occur in the lower levels, while all other aspects of the 4a assemblage are distributed relatively evenly throughout the levels ( Fig. 5 ). The 4a bifaces are also generally more weathered than the rest of the 4a assemblage, suggesting that they may have been subjected to longer surface exposure or higher-energy transport. Thus, at KP1, non-behavioral processes may explain the association of bifaces with the rest of the stratum 4a assemblage. Further excavations that focus on site formation processes are required to address the relationship of the bifaces to the remainder of the assemblage from stratum 4a.

2.2. Lithic assemblage

The material from the original excavations is housed at the McGregor Museum, Kimberley, South Africa. The entire excavated assemblage from strata 3 and 4 at KP1 consists of more than 2000 kg of lithic remains from 35.9 cubic metres. Twenty-one 1 m 2 units were excavated between 1978 and 1990 ( Fig. 6 ) by arbitrary spits of 10 or 20 cm. The assemblage is suitable for a detailed technological analysis because during excavations, all lithic artifacts were collected from sieves that were 15 mm or smaller, each individual artifact was marked with provenience data indicating square and level (expressed as depth below top of stratum 3), and most, if not all, stages of lithic reduction are represented in the assemblage based on the presence of cortical pieces, cores, core trimming elements, blanks, and retouched pieces. Prior to now, the lithic collection of Kathu Pan has not been described beyond basic industrial assignment ( Beaumont, 1990b , 2004 ) and a preliminary analysis based on a sample of 217 flakes and blades ( Porat et al., 2010 ).

3. KP1 and the Fauresmith

To put the KP1 assemblage in broader perspective requires consideration of the relationship between this assemblage and the Fauresmith Industry. The Fauresmith industry was originally defined in the first half of the twentieth century, based on surface collections and field observations in what was called the Fauresmith district and neighboring areas in the Free State, South Africa ( Goodwin and Van Riet Lowe, 1929 ). The original definition of the Fauresmith focused on small finely-made handaxes on flakes, cleavers, and scrapers ( Goodwin and Van Riet Lowe, 1929 : 72–85), while later discussions emphasized the co-occurrence of handaxes and Levallois points (ie. Beaumont and Vogel, 2006 ), and prepared cores and blades (i.e. Beaumont, 1990b :79). Besides KP1, Fauresmith-designated assemblages appear to be stratified above Acheulean and beneath MSA deposits at two other excavated sites in the Northern Cape– Pniel 6 ( Beaumont, 1990c ), and Canteen Koppie ( Beaumont and McNabb, 2000 ). At the excavated sites of Bundu Farm ( Kiberd, 2006 ) and Rooidam 1 ( Fock, 1968 ; Butzer, 1974 ; Beaumont, 1990d ; Szabo and Butzer, 1979 ), Fauresmith assemblages are stratified beneath MSA deposits. At Wonderwerk Cave, Beaumont and Vogel (2006) identified a Fauresmith component in Major Units 3 and 4. These Major Units are identified in Excavations 1 and 2 in the front of the cave; Excavation 3 and 4 in the middle of the cave; and Excavation 6 at the back of the cave (total length of Wonderwerk cave is ca. 140 m). It is important to emphasize that there are no continuous profiles linking the different excavation areas so that the correlation of excavation specific strata into site-wide Major Units does not rest on observed stratigraphy. Reanalysis of the Wonderwerk assemblage by the second author has failed to identify either a reduction in biface size or the appearance of systematic blade manufacture in either Excavation 1 or 2 leading to a question regarding the identification of the Fauresmith in the front part of the cave ( Chazan et al., 2008 ). The assemblages from the middle of the cave (Excavation 3 and 4) have not yet been analyzed. The assemblage from Excavation 6 identified as Fauresmith does show clear evidence of systematic blade production in association with bifaces ( Chazan and Horwitz, 2010 ), and according to Beaumont and Vogel (2006) this underlies an MSA assemblage.

Securely dated contexts with Fauresmith assemblages are rare. The Fauresmith at Bundu Farm ( Kiberd, 2006 ) and Rooidam 1 ( Szabo and Butzer, 1979 ) may provide minimum age estimates of 145.7 ± 16.0 ka and 174 ± 20 ka, respectively ( Herries, 2011 : 12,14). At Wonderwerk Cave, the age estimates for the Excavation 6 assemblage are limited. Paleomagnetic ages show that the archaeological contexts were deposited during a period of normal polarity and are younger than ∼780 ka ( Matmon et al., in press ). Cosmogenic burial age dating failed to provide ages relevant to the archaeology due to the long duration of transport processes within the cave ( Matmon et al., in press ). Beaumont and Vogel (2006) report a single U–Th age on a stalagmite from Excavation 6, Stratum 3 (U-576). The corrected age for U-576 is 187 ± 8 ka, but this is described as a minimum age. As pointed out by Herries (2011 : 12–13), without more detailed contextual information on this sample it is difficult to assess its relevance to the archaeological context. If in fact this is a piece of in situ stalagmite it suggests that the Fauresmith-designated assemblage of Excavation 6 is greater than 179 ka, however further work is needed to determine the age of Excavation 6 at Wonderwerk Cave.

Despite the continued use of the term, the Fauresmith industry has never been clearly defined and assemblage characteristics used to identify the Fauresmith have been inconsistent and often contradictory ( Underhill, 2011 ). While this reality poses problems for studying the Fauresmith, it also highlights that necessity for thorough description of Fauresmith-designated assemblages. The analysis presented here provides the first detailed technological description of a Fauresmith assemblage. There are very little data regarding blade production strategies at other Fauresmith sites, but blades are present in the Excavation 6 at Wonderwerk Cave ( Chazan and Horwitz, 2010 ), Rooidam 1 and 2 ( Beaumont, 1990d ; Szabo and Butzer, 1979 ), Biessiesput 1 ( Beaumont, 1990d ), Nooitegedacht 2 ( Beaumont, 1990a ), Roseberry Plain ( Beaumont, 1990a ), Pniel 1 and 6 ( Beaumont, 1990c , e ), and Bestwood 1 ( Chazan et al., in press ). Because detailed descriptions of those assemblages are not available, the results published here can only serve as an early step toward defining and understanding the significance of the Fauresmith. If the methods utilized here are applied to other Fauresmith-designated assemblages in the future, robust inter-site comparisons could lead to a clearer definition and evaluation of the Fauresmith Industry.
4. Sample selection and methods

A total of 6052 lithic artifacts from stratum 4a in four out of twenty excavated square units were analyzed ( Table 2 , Fig. 6 ). The four squares (F23, F21, C23, and C21) were selected so that a section of the richest deposit of stratum 4a sediments was sampled, so that lithic assemblage characteristics could be correlated with sedimentary features preserved in the north wall (F23 and F21), and because sediment samples from the 1978–1990 excavations for cross-referencing with the site stratigraphy were available for C23 and C21.

Procedures for technological description were adapted from those outlined by Villa et al. (2005) and Soriano et al. (2007) for South African MSA blade assemblages. The analysis began with sorting artifacts into basic lithic categories ( Table 2 ). Artifacts >15 mm in maximum length (complete flakes and proximal flake fragments, blades and blade fragments, cores and core fragments and retouched pieces ( n  = 3786)) were then selected from the assemblage for grouping into technical categories. This method was effective for identifying and describing MSA blade production strategies at Rose Cottage Cave ( Soriano et al., 2007 ) and Klasies River Mouth ( Villa et al., 2010 ). Additional metric and technological attributes were recorded for a sub-sample of each technical category (see Supplementary information for further details).

The results presented here focus on the blade component of the KP1 assemblage. Complete results regarding other components of the assemblage will be reported elsewhere.
5. Raw materials

There are a variety of lithic raw material types in the region surrounding Kathu Pan ( Table 3 ). These include banded ironstone (also locally called “jaspilite” or “jasper”), which is a sedimentary rock consisting of layered bands of iron-rich magnetite or haematite and chert or shale. This material is the most commonly used raw material at the site and is widely available as river-rolled cobbles at secondary sources (rivers and stream beds) or at the primary source about 7 km to the east of KP1 (Kuruman Hills, Fig. 2 ). Some varieties of banded ironstone can be extremely homogenous and of excellent quality for knapping.

    Table 3.

    Primary and secondary sources for raw material types available in the Kathu region and percent frequencies utilized at KP1. Percent frequencies based on counts of complete flakes and proximal flake fragments, blades and blade fragments, cores, and retouched pieces from stratum 4a, squares F21 and F23 ( n  = 1577), and a sample from two levels in stratum 4b (Acheulean), square F21 ( n  = 157).

Other raw material types (black chert, quartzite, quartz, and volcanic) are used in lower frequencies and are available at primary sources up to a minimum distance of 19 km from the site ( Table 3 ), but given the proximity of modern stream beds <4 km away, it is possible that secondary sources of these raw materials were available to hominins within the immediate vicinity of KP1. Quartzite is the one exception. The closest available source of quartzite is the Gamagara River 10 km to the west.

Many lithics from stratum 4a exhibit various shades of patinas including white, grey/blue, and pink ( Fig. 7 ). A sample of this material was sectioned and the cuts show that the majority of lithics were manufactured from either relatively homogenous banded ironstone or homogenous zones of iron-rich chert within the banded ironstone formation. The development of whitish patina is common on dark cherts and may be due to the dissolution of silica from the lithic surfaces in an alkaline environment ( Luedtke, 1992 :99) or the leaching of iron-oxides from the lithic surface in an acidic environment ( Clark and Purdy, 1979 ).

Humphreys (1970) argued that the Fauresmith is not an entity distinct from the Acheulean, but appears to be distinct because of raw material factors. He based this conclusion on the observation that most Fauresmith sites near Kimberley are located in areas were hornfels outcrops, whereas Acheulean sites are located where Ventersdorp lava and dolerite are readily available. The KP1 assemblage does not support this hypothesis. First, the 4a assemblage was not manufactured on hornfels. Second, the 4a assemblage was manufactured on the same raw material types as the underlying Acheulean assemblage ( Table 3 ). The distributions of raw material types between stratum 4a and 4b are not significantly different ( χ 2 (5, N  = 1734) = 2.81, p  = 0.73).
6. Blade production at KP1
6.1. End product characteristics

Blade production at KP1 was a regular and purposeful practice (ie. systematic), as evidenced in part by the following end product characteristics: (1) blades are a numerous component of the assemblage, (2) they are relatively large in size and have a high length to width ratio, and (3) retouched pieces in the KP1 assemblage were selectively manufactured on blades.
6.1.1. Blade frequency and metrics

Blades and blade fragments make of 16.1% of the entire lithic assemblage ( Table 2 , Fig. 7 , Fig. 8  and  Fig. 9 ). Blades and blade fragments represent more than a quarter (27.0%) of all discarded detached pieces (including flakes and flake fragments).

A summary of the KP1 blade metrics is provided in Table 4 . The average length of complete blades is approximately 70 mm, but there is great variability in blade size. The upper limits of blade length in this sample approaches 150 mm and the minimum length is less than 15 mm. A frequency histogram of blade width ( Fig. 10 ) can be used to get a sense of size distribution (see Soriano et al., 2007 ; Villa et al., 2010 ), providing a larger sample than length because blades often break transversely. KP1 blade size distribution includes blades that would technically be classified as bladelets (<12 mm in width, Soriano et al., 2007 ), but these small blades are just at the lower end of a unimodal blade size continuum. The mean length to width ratio of the KP1 blades is 2.5:1 ( n  = 92, sd = 0.4).

6.1.2. Retouched pieces

Retouched pieces represent 12.1% of the analyzed KP1 stratum 4a sample ( Table 2 ). Unifacially worked pointed forms ( Fig. 7 h, j, k) are the most striking category and make up 19.9% of the retouched pieces ( Table 5 ).

Blades were often selected as blanks for retouched pieces. Table 5 presents a comparison of all retouched types for square F23 against retouched types on flake and blade blanks. All categories of retouched pieces were made on both flake and blade blanks, but there is a pattern indicative of preferential selection for blades. Blades are overrepresented in the retouched pieces component of the assemblage compared to the debitage. There is a 1:1 flake to blade ratio within the retouched pieces for which the blank could be determined ( Table 5 ), even though there is a 2.7:1 flake to blade ratio in the debitage. The difference between the flake and blade counts in the debitage and in the retouched pieces is statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p  < 0.01).

Unifacially retouched pointed forms exhibit the strongest pattern of selection for blade blanks. Of the 23 pointed forms for which the blank could be determined, more were manufactured on blades ( n  = 14) than on flakes ( n  = 9, Table 5 ). All of the pointed forms that were manufactured on blades were manufactured on B1 blades (produced during optimal phase of debitage).
6.2. Percussion technique

A bulb and platform analysis ( Soriano et al., 2007 ; Villa et al., 2010 ), was used to determine the percussion technique for blade production. Table 6 summarizes the results and Fig. 11 provides examples of some of the features. The high frequencies of large prominent bulbs (80.6%), thick platforms (82.9% greater than 5 mm), shattered bulbs (32.6%, Fig. 11 f), and platforms with a broken delineation (12.4%, Fig. 11 e) are consistent with direct hard hammer percussion that is away from the core edge (i.e. internal, not marginal). These observations contrast those observed for the levels attributed to the Howiesons Poort (a subphase of the MSA, 65–60 ka, Jacobs et al., 2008 ) at Rose Cottage Cave and Klasies River Mouth where the authors argue that marginal percussion with a soft stone hammer was the technique used for blade production ( Table 6 ).

    Table 6.

Traits that exhibit divergence between KP1 and the Howiesons Poort assemblages but similarity between KP1 and the experimental hard hammer sample are bolded.

An experimental sample ( n  = 147) of debitage from hard hammer percussion of banded ironstone cores local to the Kathu region was also subjected to the same bulb and platform analysis. This experimental sample yielded trait frequencies similar to the KP1 blades, demonstrating higher frequencies of thick and wide quadrangular platforms and shattered bulbs, but very low frequencies of lipped platforms without a bulb ( Table 6 ). An interesting observation is that 32.0% of platforms on KP1 blades were lipped or had a slight lip ( Fig. 11 c), which is a trait generally associated with soft hammer or indirect percussion for MSA assemblages (eg. Wurz, 2000 , 2002 ). Of the hard hammer experimental debitage sample, 42.5% also were lipped or had a slight lip, consistent with the interpretation that direct hard hammer percussion was used to detach blades at KP1.
6.3. Reduction strategy

The cores from stratum 4a at KP1 were extensively prepared for blade removal. Discarded blade cores have a distinct morphology, and platforms and dorsal surfaces were often intensively prepared immediately prior to blade detachment. These aspects of the core reduction strategy support the identification of purposeful and systematic blade production.
6.3.1. Core preparation

Based on the distribution of blade technical categories ( Table 7 ), it is possible to argue that KP1 cores for blade production were usually prepared using centripetal flaking. Blades with at least 50% cortex are present ( Fig. 7 a), but in low frequencies (3.8%) and there is a low frequency of blades with some cortex (4.7%). In contrast, 5.3% of complete flakes and proximal flake fragments exhibit >50% cortex and 12.8% exhibit some cortex ( Fig. 12 ). The low frequency of blades with cortex compared to flakes suggests that blade cores were prepared first by flake removals. The rarity of crested blades (0.3%, Table 7 ) and the presence of blades with centripetal flake dorsal scars on one side only (4.2%, Fig. 9 e,h) are most consistent with a reduction strategy that generally prepared the blade exploitation surface with centripetal flake removals.

    Table 7.

6.3.2. Core maintenance

Cores were not maintained with second generation crested flakes ( Soriano et al., 2007 ) or neo-crested blades ( Villa et al., 2010 ), as these blade types are absent from the KP1 assemblage ( Table 7 ). Centripetal flaking of dorsal and lateral convexities rejuvenated surfaces for blade production as evidenced by the presence of blades with centripetal flake removals (4.2%, Fig. 9 ). Débordant flakes/blades with unidirectional or bidirectional dorsal scars and a preserved lateral platform surface are also present in the assemblage ( n  = 13, 1.3%, Fig. 9 a) and may have sometimes been used to rejuvenate core edges.
6.3.3. Core exploitation: directionality and recurrence

Blades were generally exploited from two opposed platforms. Among blades for which dorsal scar directionality could be confidently determined, there are more bidirectional blades ( n  = 146, 66.4%) than unidirectional blades ( n  = 33.6%, 74). For blades from the optimal phase of debitage alone (B1, Fig. 8 ), 80.3% are bidirectional. Blades preserving a distal striking platform ( Fig. 7 d) further attest to the bidirectional production of blades.

Blades from the optimal phase of debitage (B1, Fig. 8 ) which exhibit dorsal scars parallel to the long axis of percussion, are consistent with recurrent (ie. serial) blade removals. The exploitation surface is not re-prepared between every removal.
6.3.4. Platform and dorsal surface preparation

Platforms and dorsal surfaces at KP1 were highly prepared. Many platforms were faceted immediately prior to blade detachment ( Table 6 , 36.4% faceted platforms with bulbs). Dorsal surfaces often exhibit extensive preparation with small hinged removals or small more elongated dorsal scars (48.8%, Fig. 11 d).
6.3.5. Discarded blade core morphology

Two types of blade cores were identified ( Table 8 ); rare “unorganized” blade cores with few blade removals from unprepared surfaces, and Levallois-like bifacial hierarchical blade cores with domed upper surface, steep lateral edges, and bidirectional flake scars ( Fig. 13 ). Together, the two types of blade cores make up 14.6% of all identifiable cores types in the KP1 assemblage. The remainder and majority of discarded cores in the KP1 assemblage are flake cores. Flake production was likely an additional objective of core reduction at KP1 and the low frequency of blade cores might be a consequence of changing reduction strategies through the life history of the cores. Some cores that were initially used for blade extraction might have been exploited in a different way for flake production just prior to discard. This pattern is apparent on some of the discarded cores where the final removals are slightly below a length to width ratio of 2:1, or flake scars overlay and truncate the final blade removals ( Fig. 13 ).

The KP1 organized blade core reduction is related to Levallois as defined by Boëda (1995) . The cores consist of two asymmetrical convex surfaces with roles that were irreversible and the flaking surface was maintained in a way that created lateral and distal convexities to guide the shock wave of each predetermined blank ( Fig. 14 ). Blade core reduction at KP1 diverges slightly from Boëda's (1995) definition in that the upper exploitation surface of the core carries more volume than the lower platform surface. The lateral convexities are steep and sit much lower than the platform ( Fig. 13  and  Fig. 14 ).

7. Comparative analysis

The data presented here on blade production strategies at KP1 permit comparison with published data for early blade industries from the Kapthurin Formation, East Africa ( Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ) and the Amudian industry at Qesem Cave ( Barkai et al., 2009 ; Shimelmitz, 2009 ; Shimelmitz et al., 2011 ). Comparison across such a wide geographical scale is difficult and there are multiple factors to consider when interpreting the meaning of technological variability, including raw material properties and distribution, site function, foraging strategies and mobility. Assessing the significance of differences and similarities between these three sites requires distinguishing traits linked to aspects of technological behavior from traits linked to other factors. Different raw materials were used for blade production at the three sites compared here. Blade production mainly occurred on large cobbles of banded ironstone at KP1, on small cobbles of fine-grained phonolite at the Kapthurin Formation, and small flat flint nodules at Qesem Cave. While raw material characteristics do affect lithic artifact variability to some degree, recent replication and experimental studies downgrade the assumed primacy of raw material physical properties ( Eren et al., 2011 ) and core surface morphology ( Rezek et al., 2011 ) on end product and assemblage characteristics. At all three sites considered here, raw materials were foraged from less than 5 km away, so distance to source is a relatively constant variable in the comparisons.

Three traits are examined here – intensity of blade production, end product characteristics, and methods of production. Of these three traits, it seems most likely that intensity of blade production and end product characteristics might be linked in part to aspects of site function in open-air vs. cave contexts, or foraging strategies and mobility (e.g. Andrefsky, 1994 ; Binford, 1982 ; Kuhn, 1994 ; Rolland and Dibble, 1990 ), while the methods of production are likely to mainly reflect patterns of learned behavior or technological style (e.g. Dobres, 2000 ; Gamble, 1999 ; Geneste et al., 1990 ; Schlanger, 1994 ). When cores are systematically prepared and maintained for blade production and the same strategies recur for numerous core reductions, these strategies could represent learned technological behaviors shared across generations. In some contexts, different blade frequencies between sites may be linked to differences in core reduction strategies because blade frequency will depend on the amount and method of core preparation. If the morphological differences of the non-retouched and retouched blades are indicative of differences in final product mental templates, then the size and form of detached pieces and the characteristics of the retouched pieces can also reflect different objectives (e.g. Delagnes, 1995 : 203–204) and result from different intended tool functions. Thus, comparing the earliest laminar technologies permits a preliminary assessment of whether Middle Pleistocene blade production reflects similar strategies and objectives that potentially diffused from a single centre of innovation, or diverse strategies and objectives that were potentially developed multiple times in multiple places.
7.1. How does KP1 blade production compare to that in the Kapthurin Formation 550–500 ka?

Blades recovered from the lower Kapthurin Formation, Kenya (sites GnJh-42 and GnJh-50) are bracketed by tuffs securely dated by 40 Ar/ 30 Ar to 545 ± 3 and 509 ± 9 ka ( Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ) and are thus roughly contemporary with KP1. Based on comparisons with published results, blade production at KP1 is distinct from blade production in the Kapthurin Formation with respect to the frequency and characteristics of the laminar end products and more importantly, the manner and degree to which the core is prepared and exploited for blade removals ( Table 9 ).

A comparison of relative blade frequencies suggests that the Kapthurin sites demonstrate a less regular emphasis on blade production than KP1. Relative to sample size, blades have a much higher frequency in the KP1 assemblage than the Kapthurin assemblage. Only 2.7% of the artifacts at GnJh-42 and 2.5% at GnJh-50 are blades or blade fragments. In contrast, 16% of the KP1 artifacts are blades or blade fragments. Based on presented counts ( Table 1 in Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ), the two Kapthurin sites together exhibit a flake to blade ratio of 36.6:1 and the flake to blade ratio at KP1 is only 2.7:1. The difference between the flake and blade counts at the combined Kapthurin sites are statistically different from the flake and blade counts at KP1 (Fisher's exact test, p  < 0.01). The low frequency of blades at the Kapthurin sites could in part be related to the ephemeral, open-air occupation that the site represents.

Metric data given for the Kapthurin blades indicate that mean blade length and width are slightly lower at the Kapthurin sites than at KP1 ( Table 9 ) and despite the small sample size from the Kapthurin sites, these differences are statistically significant (length, t (115) = 2.01, p  = 0.046, width, t (524) = 3.34, p  < 0.001). The smaller size of blades at the Kapthurin sites might be related to the smaller initial size of cobbles.

The mean length to width ratio (2.7:1) is slightly higher at the Kapthurin sites than at KP1 (2.5:1), but the difference is not statistically significant ( t (96) = 0.1931, p  = 0.85).

The discarded blades at the Kapthurin sites were not retouched, whereas many KP1 blades were retouched into pointed forms, scrapers, and denticulates. This difference suggests that there were different objectives for the production of blade blanks, though an argument could be made that the lack of retouched pieces at the Kapthurin sites could also be related to site function as the sites appear to be brief ephemeral occupations.

For the Kapthurin sites, the prominent bulbs, prominent negative bulbs on the cores, and the fragmentary nature of blades are cited as evidence that direct hard hammer percussion was used ( Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 :196), similar to KP1.

Core reduction strategies for blade production are very different between KP1 and the Kapthurin sites. Blade core reduction in the Kapthurin Formation was not related to Levallois methods of reduction. Blades generally followed the long edge of one preparatory flake scar with little to no core preparation. Blades were extracted unidirectionally or centripetally and the reduction strategy is similar to the ‘Hummal’ volumetric concept ( Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 :195). Faceting of platforms was rare at the Kapthurin sites, in contrast to the platforms at KP1, which were often extensively prepared. Of the many differences identified here, the differences between KP1 and Kapthurin blade core reduction methods are the most likely to reflect patterns of learned behavior that are distinct between the two geographic locations.
7.2. How does blade production compare to the Amudian Industry at Qesem Cave?

230 Th/ 234 U analyses of in situ speleothems at the site of Qesem Cave, Israel dates the earliest occurrence of the Amudian Industry at the site to between ∼420–320 ka ( Gopher et al., 2010 ). The earliest artifact-bearing horizons lay under a speleothem crust dated to 300 ± 30 ka, and are interbedded with a speleothem dated to 320 ± 30 ka and 300 ± 10 ka. Underlying speleothems give a maximum age for the first occupation of the cave at 420 + 60/−50 ka. The Amudian industry at Qesem Cave persisted to between ∼220–194 ka ( Gopher et al., 2010 ). A comparison between KP1 and the Qesem Cave Amudian assemblage indicate that the two laminar technologies differ with respect to end product frequency and characteristics and the degree and type of core preparation and maintenance ( Table 9 ).

Blades make up a larger percentage of the Qesem Cave assemblage than the KP1 assemblage. Based on the ratio of all flake detached pieces ( n  = 3909) to all laminar detached pieces ( n  = 2495) ( Shimelmitz et al., 2011 ), the flake to blade ratio is 1.6:1 at Qesem Cave and this is less than what is observed at KP1 (2.7:1). The flake and blade counts at Qesem Cave and KP1 are statistically different ( χ 2 (1, N  = 10,008) = 145.89, p  < 0.01).

The greater frequency of blades in the Qesem assemblage might be due to the observation that blade cores at KP1 are prepared and maintained with flake removals, a practice not characteristic of the Qesem Cave Amudian assemblage. At Qesem Cave, little or no shaping of the core occurred before the first blade was removed, and overshot blades were detached to maintain and rejuvenate the debitage surface more often than flakes ( Shimelmitz et al., 2011 : 472–473). In this case, the differences in blade frequencies between KP1 and Qesem Cave might best explained by differences in core reduction strategy, rather than differences in how regularly or frequently blades were manufactured onsite. However, it is also possible that differences in blade frequency could be related to cave vs. open-air contexts.

Qesem Cave blades are on average smaller than the KP1 blades, but have similar elongation ratios. T -tests from parameters using the mean, number, and standard deviation for each category of laminar item reported by Shimelmitz et al. (2011 :466) indicate that mean length and width are statistically different from KP1 ( Table 10 ). Elongation is not statistically different between Qesem Cave and KP1 ( Table 10 ).

Laminar items were frequently retouched at Qesem Cave, quite often along one lateral edge and/or the distal edge ( Shimelmitz, 2009 ), but not into pointed forms as at KP1, suggesting that the objectives for blade production differed between the two sites.

Like KP1, blades were probably removed using direct hard hammer percussion at Qesem Cave based on the presence of large bulbs, the occurrence of bulbs with double impact points, and thick platforms usually >3 mm ( Shimelmitz, 2009 : 83–84).

As mentioned above, core preparation and maintenance at Qesem Cave was minimal. Reduction usually utilized a natural edge on a small cobble. When preparation or maintenance was required, edges were often crested, resulting in a fairly high percentage of crested blades ( n  = 199, 2.2% of the debitage and shaped items, Table 1  and  Table 9 in Shimelmitz, 2009 ), compared to Kathu Pan ( n  = 3, 0.1%). Platforms were not generally prepared at Qesem Cave. These characteristics contrast those observed for KP1 blade production where core surfaces and platforms are extensively prepared. Blade core reduction methods at KP1 are distinct from those at Qesem Cave, and the differences are likely to relate to different learned technological behaviors at the two geographically distant locations.
8. Discussion

Blade production at KP1 adds to the known variants of laminar technology and the emerging appreciation for technological diversity in the early Upper and Middle Pleistocene (e.g. Bar-Yosef and Kuhn, 1999 ; Delagnes and Meignen, 2006 ; Foley and Lahr, 1997 ; Johnson and McBrearty, 2010 ; McBrearty and Brooks, 2000 ; McBrearty et al., 1996 ; Shea, 2011 ; Tryon et al., 2005 ). The comparative study between the three earliest known laminar assemblages presented here also indicates that diversity was probably present at the onset of blade producing behaviors between ∼550 and 400 ka. Some of this diversity may be explained by raw material differences, or site context and function. However, there are aspects of the assemblages that these factors are unlikely to explain. The methods of blade production and the association of blade blanks with retouched points are unique to KP1 among the Middle Pleistocene blade assemblages. These observations draw attention to aspects of core reduction related to learned patterns of behavior and argue against a single origin for blade production in the Middle Pleistocene. The evidence for diversity in early Middle Pleistocene laminar technologies supports a scenario in which hominin groups in Africa and the Levant were inventing new core reduction strategies to suit their own resource extraction requirements. Bar-Yosef and Kuhn (1999) argued that prior to the Upper Paleolithic, blades came and went, that the advantages of blade production were situationally relevant, and that the choice to practice blade production was related to local economic factors. The data presented here, which highlights the differences between the earliest examples of blade production, are in line with that hypothesis, though it also appears that blade production behaviors persisted for some time in some contexts. Blades have also been recovered from more recent contexts (509–285 ka) in the Kapthurin Formation ( Deino and McBrearty, 2002 ), and at Qesem Cave the Amudian Industry is present in multiple strata and persisted at the site until at least 220 ka ( Gopher et al., 2010 ). Future research is required to elucidate the significance and chronological limits of Fauresmith-designated assemblages in southern Africa.

It is not yet possible to identify the specific relevant economic factors that may have influenced the invention and adoption of laminar technologies in geographically distant regions across Africa and the Levant. Blades are sometimes argued to provide an adaptive advantage by conserving raw material. However, experimental research shows that blade reduction does not always provide a higher cutting-edge to volume ratio compared to Levallois reduction ( Eren et al., 2008 ). At KP1, raw material conservation seems an unlikely explanation for the adoption of laminar technologies given the nearly identical raw material usage patterns between the Fauresmith and Acheulean occupations, but future work elucidating specific economic factors that may have selected for the adoption of blade production behaviors in one locale, such as Kathu Pan, can bring researchers closer to understanding the significance of blade technologies in the Middle Pleistocene. A global and comparative perspective is also necessary because the diversity in early laminar technologies could either represent multiple responses to a single adaptive problem (ie. the need to conserve raw material), or similar responses (ie. the production of elongated blanks) to solve different adaptive problems. In other words, even if one method of blade production was adopted in one context as a means of conserving raw material, a different method of blade production may have been adopted for different reasons in another context.

The results presented here best support a multiple origins hypothesis for the practice of blade production, but the hypothesis requires further testing. One factor inhibiting our ability to test the multiple origins hypothesis further is the rarity of securely dated archeological and associated fossil occurrences from the earlier half of the Middle Pleistocene. Large gaps in the archaeological record make it challenging to assess the meaning of lithic technological variability. Chronological control for the early Middle Pleistocene is an additional obstacle; even though the Kapthurin sites and KP1 are roughly contemporary based on current age estimates, the inherent error ranges means that the KP1 assemblage could be up to 182 thousand years older than or 113 thousand years younger than the Kapthurin assemblages. The Qesem Cave assemblage could be as young as 290 ka, which would make it at least 145 thousand years younger than KP1. Thus, we cannot completely discount chronological explanations for the diversity between the three blade assemblages analyzed here. Furthermore, raw material characteristics and original nodule shape could potentially affect end product characteristics and core reduction strategies, introducing an aspect of diversity unrelated to shared traditions or cultural transmission. One could argue that, even if the practice of blade production had a single origin, we might reasonably expect local populations to adapt what might have started out as a shared strategy to best exploit the raw materials available to them. The extent to which the morphology and fracture characteristics of locally available raw materials at KP1, Kapthurin, and Qesem Cave might affect the diversity in the specific laminar technologies presented here still deserves further consideration. Furthermore, future research needs to investigate the influence that site function, duration of occupation, and mobility exert on Middle Pleistocene laminar assemblages and test our assumption that blade core reduction methods identified from archaeological contexts are mainly linked to patterns of learned technological behavior.
9. Conclusions

Systematic blade production characterized hominin technological behavior at KP1 ∼500 ka. Blades were removed using direct hard hammer percussion from organized blade cores that were extensively prepared via centripetal flaking. Some of these blades were retouched into points. KP1 blade core reduction strategies are distinct from those represented at the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya 550–500 ka and from Qesem Cave, Israel beginning ∼420–320 ka with respect to the degree and nature of core preparation and end product characteristics, adding to known variability in Pleistocene blade technology. The diversity in the three earliest laminar technologies could indicate that hominin groups in Africa and the Levant were inventing and adopting laminar technologies to suit their own resource extraction requirements. The capacity to invent blade technology may be related to other changes in the early Middle Pleistocene ∼780–350 ka, but further research is required to solidify and explain any potential correlations with other technological shifts, Homo heidelbergensis sensu lato , and increased climatic instability.

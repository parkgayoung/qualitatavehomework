Abstract

Assemblages classified as ‘Upper Paleolithic’ in the Korean peninsula are diverse in their composition, including not only some blade industries but also conventional ones continued from earlier Paleolithic periods. This has often been explained as the result of an indigenous development. However, the ‘heterogenic’ character of Upper Paleolithic industries is the result of the continuing influx of modern human populations via two different routes: (1) from Siberia and (2) from southern China. Blade technology from Siberia appeared in the Korean peninsula around 35 000 BP and coexisted with core and flake stone industries carried by modern humans from southern China and Southeast Asia throughout the Upper Paleolithic. This explanation is based on the current observation of patterns of Upper Paleolithic industries in East Asia. Blade industries have been found only in the northern part of East Asia while none have been reported in southern China, although modern Homo evidently dispersed via two different routes from the Near East. The ‘North-South Model’ of Modern Homo migrations into the Korean peninsula is supported by a genetic analysis of the Y-chromosome of the modern population in this region. Continuing influx of modern human population from both origins to the peninsula can explain the consistent presence of Upper Paleolithic industries that appear heterogenic.
1. Introduction

Almost 100 Upper Paleolithic sites have been discovered in the Korean peninsula, including sites of microlithic stone industries, since the first find at the Sokchangni site in the early 1960s. During the last half century, typological and chronological research of Upper Paleolithic industries has been carried out by several Paleolithic archaeologists, but few attempts have been made to understand the origin and the development processes ( Norton et al., 2007 ). Understanding the origin of Upper Paleolithic industries in the Korean peninsula is critical for an explanation of Upper Paleolithic origins in East Asia. Also, Upper Paleolithic industries in the Korean peninsula cannot be understood without consideration of penecontemporaneous Paleolithic cultures in adjacent regions, including China, Mongolia, Siberia, and Japan Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 , Fig. 4  and  Fig. 5 .

The development of Upper Paleolithic cultures has often been discussed in relation to modern human dispersal ( Mellars, 1998  and  Klein, 1999 ). In particular, blade technology and some human activities related to art and religion have been generally considered evidence of modern human dispersal. However, there are many parts of Eurasia where the archaeological record cannot be explained in this scheme of evolutionary processes of Upper Paleolithic culture. For example, few or no such cultural phenomena have been observed in huge areas of southeastern Asia and the southern part of mainland China. Many speculative suggestions have not provided any clear explanations of cultural patterns in this region during the Upper Paleolithic. This paper suggests that the complex pattern of the Upper Paleolithic in the Korean peninsula is derived from multiple origins, some of which have not yet been considered Table 1 .

The origin of the Upper Paleolithic in the Korean peninsula is one of the most interesting cultural phenomena that contribute to reconstructions of modern human dispersal in eastern Asia. Furthermore, it provides data for understanding the patterning of human dispersal in eastern Eurasia during the last glacial period, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of modern human adaptive processes, particularly in the more remote regions of the Old World.
2. Stone industries and chronology

The Upper Paleolithic in the Korean peninsula is often defined by the presence of blade technology, the imported raw material of siliceous rocks, and rather extensive secondary retouching for making relatively specialized edges on small pieces ( Bae, 2002 , Bae, 2003 , Lee, 2002  and  Norton et al., 2007 ). However, the boundary of the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic is still not clear, because no definite agreement has been reached on the definition of Upper Paleolithic industries. Introduction of blade technology is indisputable evidence of the beginning, as in other parts of the world. However, many stone industries without any blade technology and assemblages comprised of a mixture of blade stone tools with traditional core and flake artefacts made on quartz and quartzite materials are observed in layers which are considered to date from the latest Late Pleistocene, younger than 40 000 BP. Accordingly, assemblages classified as ‘Upper Paleolithic’ are diverse in their composition.

The beginning of the Upper Paleolithic in the Korean peninsula has not been well clarified and still remains to be debated. This is so because ‘Upper Paleolithic’ has not been defined for lithic technology, but for relative stratigraphic position of industries and chronometric dates. It has been argued that some industries without any blade technology appeared in the early stage of the Upper Paleolithic in the peninsula, hardly distinguishable from industries in the previous stage, the so called ‘Middle Paleolithic’ 1 . Even local development of blade technology from the so called ‘pebble tool tradition’ in the previous stage, which could be called ‘Middle Paleolithic’ or ‘Early Paleolithic’, has been claimed, on the basis of presence of occasional elongate flakes which eventually developed to blade technology in the middle Upper Paleolithic Age ( Lee, 2005 , Seong, 2006a  and  Seong, 2006b ). However, it is hardly likely that blade technology was developed in the Korean peninsula, considering the general pattern in the Old World.

Blade technology was observed at the Sokchangni site in 1963 for the first time in the peninsula ( Sohn, 1967  and  Sohn, 1978 ), and was 14 C dated to 30 690 BP. This age had been considered until recently to represent the lower boundary of the introduction of blade technology to the Korean peninsula. At present, Upper Paleolithic industries have been found in most provinces in the southern part of the peninsula ( Fig. 1 ). Many were found in fine sediments on riverine terraces of major river basins. Some were found in colluviums on hill slopes, and even in mountain ranges, such as the Koryeri site in the southeastern part of the Korean peninsula ( Kim et al., 2002 ). A high density of Upper Paleolithic sites is observed in the Youngsan and Bosung river basins in the southwestern part of the peninsula. Not many blade and microblade sites have been reported in North Korea, though this is likely due to the lack of extensive archaeological research. It can be expected that many sites in the northern part of the peninsula will be reported in the future ( Norton, 2000 ). At present, the only North Korean site where Upper Paleolithic technology has been found is the Mandal cave site. Microblade cores made on obsidian were found in the cave along with anatomically modern humans, Mandal Man ( Seo, 1987 ).

Elaborate tools began to appear during the Upper Paleolithic on fine siliceous materials including end scrapers, burins, various types of side scrapers, awls, becs, and denticulates. Along with these types of tools made on blades, tools on quartz and quartzite materials are continually present even though their frequency in the assemblages decreases in the late Upper Paleolithic. It is also notable that more extensive secondary retouch on tools is observed. Tanged points appeared throughout the Upper Paleolithic. Tanged points are often considered typical Upper Paleolithic stone tools, because similar stone artefacts, the ‘Hakuhen-sentoki (pointed tool on elongate flake)’ in Japan, appeared in the early stage of the Upper Paleolithic industries in the Japanese archipelago (see Matsufuji, 2004 ).

The appearance of blade technology could have been as early as 35 000 BP on the basis of current chronological evidence, although some archaeologists (e.g., Lee, 2002  and  Seong, 2006b ) suggest that the beginning of the ‘Upper Paleolithic’ may possibly go back to between 40 000 BP and 35 000 BP. It is a complicated problem to define the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, because some archaeologists believe that blade technology had been developed from the pre-existing technique of making elongate parallel sided flakes during the initial stage of the Upper Paleolithic in the Korean peninsula ( Lee, 2002  and  Jang, 2007 ). It is highly probable that the introduction of blade industries is older than 30 000 BP, possibly around 35 000 BP, on the basis of 14 C dates ( Fig. 2 ).

Different systems of chronology have been attempted on the basis of frequency of fine siliceous material for tool making, technological development of blades, and geological observation of sediments and 14 C dates ( Yi, 2001 , Lee, 2002 , Han, 2003 , Obata, 2003 , Kim et al., 2004 , Seong, 2006a  and  Seong, 2006b ). If some early industries lacking blade technology are not included, the Upper Paleolithic can be divided into two major stages on the basis of technological development: blades and microblades ( Fig. 4 ). In many Upper Paleolithic sites, these two stages appear in a series of cultural layers, but in some sites only a single stage occurs. For example, only blade tools are present at the Koryeri site, and only microblade technology at the Jangheungni site.

The early stage of the Upper Paleolithic can be represented by the industry from the Koryeri site in the southeastern part of the peninsula, which yielded very long and thick blades and relatively large prismatic cores with tanged points ( Jang, 2001 ). The age is not known, but is presumably earlier than 25 000 BP on the basis of the presence of possible AT tephra at the site ( Seo et al., 1999 ). Core preparation and patterns of secondary retouch, probably similar to those from the Shuidonggou site in northern China, can be considered to represent the early stage of blade technology ( Fig. 5 ).

The blade industries from the Hopyeong and Deokso sites located in the Han River basin in central Korea represent the early stage of the Upper Paleolithic. The blade industry from the lower level of Hopyeong was dated between 30 000 BP and 27 500 BP ( Hong and Kim, 2008 ). The long blade stone tools on volcanic tuff were found in association with a small flake industry on vein quartz. The AMS dates from Deokso are about 37 000 BP and 36 000 BP, which are older than those from Hopyeong. Although the Deokso dates may be considered too old, the blade cores resemble the early stage of blade technology.

Among the tool types that appeared in the early stage of the Upper Paleolithic, tanged points are a critical issue in the discussion of the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic in Korea since the first finds at the Suyanggae site ( Yi et al., 1999 ). A tanged point from the Yongho-dong site was found with no associations with any other blade or Upper Paleolithic tools. The point, recovered from the third cultural layer of the Yongho-dong site, was 14 C AMS-dated at 38 500 ± 1000 BP (41 926 ± 382 {cal}; Han, 2002 ). This evidence is important to understanding the development of the Upper Paleolithic and the introduction of blade technology in the Korean peninsula. Many tanged points were made on blades of fine raw material, although some were made on vein quartz, and often are assumed to be a new invention of Upper Paleolithic people. However, as the 38 500 ± 1000 BP date is considered to be too old for the ‘blade Upper Paleolithic’ in Korea, additional evidence is required. Another possible explanation is that the tool type was a local development in the Korean peninsula at some time in the terminal stage of the Middle Paleolithic, employing technology making elongate flakes, on the basis of the high frequency of its presence in the southern part of the peninsula and the very early age compared to those found in adjacent regions. The technology diffused into adjacent regions including Japan ( Matsufuji, 2004  and  Matsufuji and Okamura, 1998 ).

Microblade technology, representing the second stage of the Upper Paleolithic, appeared ca 25 000 BP and lasted until the end of the Upper Paleolithic, persisting in some parts of the Korean peninsula into the early stage of the Neolithic. Microblade cores on obsidian at the Jangheung site in the Hantan river basin in central Korea were dated at 24 000 BP and 24 200 BP ( Choi et al., 2001 ). In addition to this site, some early dates were obtained from the Sinbuk site in southwestern Korea (e.g., 25 420 ± 190 BP, 25 500 ± 1000 BP), which would be the earliest ages for microlithic industry in Korea ( Lee, 2004 ). The dates were considered somewhat older than expected in the Korean peninsula. However, the range of age dates is not extraordinary for the introduction of microlithic technology to the peninsula, considering recent evidence in China and Siberia. Some chronometric dates of microlithic sites in northern China dated older than 20 000 BP ( Kuzmin, 2007 ). Some microlithic industries in Hokkaido, Japan, are dated at 22 000 BP, and the calibrated age of the microlithic industry could be as old as 25 000 BP ( Sato and Tsutsumi, 2007  and  Izuho and Sato, 2008 ). In addition, microlithic technology is believed to have appeared around 35 000 BP, long before the LGM in the Altai region, and it spread to other parts of Siberia and northeastern Asia between 30 000 BP and 20 000 BP ( Derevianko, 2005a , Derevianko, 2005b  and  Kuzmin, 2007 ).

Various types of micro-core preparation have been observed in the Korean peninsula, primarily wedge shaped cores with very few conical cores. The microlithic tradition in Korea is clearly related to that in Siberia, Inner Mongolia and northern China ( Norton et al., 2007 ). As in the case of blades, microlithic technology has not been observed in the southern part of China, south of 35°N ( Gai, 1985 ). Even in the later part of the Upper Paleolithic in the Korean peninsula, large blades continued to appear along with microblade technology in some sites. Much more elaborate forms such as foliate bifacial points appeared in this stage, and exhaustion of cores became greater in the later part of this stage. Another change observed in microlithic industries is the absence of tanged points in industries in its final stage, which is classified as the third stage of the Upper Paleolithic by Seong (2006b) . However, the terminal stage of the Upper Paleolithic and the relationship with the Neolithic culture is still unclear, although microlith and some stone tools such as arrowheads shaped by pressure techniques appeared with pottery during the incipient Neolithic culture before typical Neolithic stone tools with ground edges had appeared ( Norton, 2007 ).

The critical problem in understanding the development of Upper Paleolithic industries in Korea is the heterogeneous composition of stone artefacts and many expedient tool types with blades or microblades ( Fig. 3 ). Large cores of different stages, polyhedrons, choppers, and even handaxes appeared in the Upper Paleolithic. Most were made on conventional raw materials, such as quartz or quartzite cobbles, which were commonly used in the previous stage of Paleolithic culture in the peninsula. These tool types decreased when microblade technology appeared. However, they did not disappear completely and continued to have been made until the final stage of the Upper Paleolithic. Considering the technological efficiency of blade technology over traditional flake-based stone industries, simple explanations of either adaptive processes or different foraging groups do not provide the full picture of the Upper Paleolithic world in the peninsula. How these heterogenic characters of the Upper Paleolithic culture in the Korean peninsula can be explained is still a serious question to be answered in the future.
3. Origin of blade technology

Despite suggestions by some archaeologists of a local development (e.g., Lee, 2005 , Seong, 2006a  and  Seong, 2006b ), blade technology in the peninsula is believed to have originated from the north, quite probably from Siberia. Blade technology in northeastern Asia is often considered to have been diffused from Siberia via the Shuidonggou site in Inner Mongolia ( Matsufuji, 2003 , Derevianko, 2005a  and  Derevianko, 2008 ). Current evidence shows that no other source exists except in Inner Mongolia for the introduction of blade technology in northeast China, the Korean peninsula, and the Japanese archipelago.

The blade technologies from Usti Karakol and Kara-Bom in the Altai region appear around 45 000 BP ( Derevianko, 2005a  and  Otte and Kozlowski, 2005 ) and are believed to have diffused toward the Baikal area by around 40 000 BP. Some early Upper Paleolithic industries in the Trans-Baikal region, such as at the Podzvonkaya and Kamenka sites, were dated at least as old as 40 000 BP, and are considered similar to those found in the Altai region ( Derevianko and Shunkov, 2004  and  Lbova, 2008 ). However, the early Upper Paleolithic in Mongolia is believed to be an archaic form, but later than in the Baikal region. Although the sediment of the second terrace of the Orkhon river bearing Upper Paleolithic industries was dated between 39 970 ± 815 and 29 465 ± 449 BP, conventional and AMS 14 C dates from Tsagaan Agui and Chikhen Agui were in the range between 34 000 BP and 26 000 BP ( Derevianko and Shunkov, 2004 ). In the Ordos region further south in Mongolia, the Shuidonggou site was uranium-series dated at 38 000 ± 800 a and 34 000 ± 2000 a. However, much younger 14 C dates of 26 230 ± 800 BP, 25 450 ± 800 BP and 16 700 ± 210 BP were obtained ( Jia and Huang, 1985 , Yamanaka, 1995  and  Matsufuji, 2003 ). Another set of 14 C dates obtained from hearth at locality 2 are placed between 29 000 and 24 000 BP ( Madsen et al., 2001 ) and are slightly later than some dates in Korea.

Although the 14 C dates are younger than some early dates from blade stone industries of the Korean peninsula, the Shuidonggou site is considered the most important source in understanding the diffusion of blade technology from the Baikal region toward the Korean peninsula and other adjacent regions. As stated above, it is the only archaic form of blade technology and the oldest in the southeastern part of Asia below the latitudes of the Altai–Mongolia. Blade cores found in the Korean peninsula are similar to those from Shuidonggou. The blade cores found in the Shuidonggou site are mostly thick prismatic forms with single or double-opposite flat striking platforms made by simple retouch. Blades were detached more often from the broad sides of the cores, not from the narrow sides. This technique is considered to be an important element of the blade technology in the Altai region ( Derevianko and Shunkov, 2004 ), and is observed in the industries of major sites in the peninsula, such as Hopyeong-dong, Deokso, Koryeri, and Sokchangni.

Important problems remain to be considered in future research concerning the origin of blade technology from Shuidonggou. At this site, blade tools were found with some Levallois elements ( Jia and Huang, 1985  and  Brantingham and Kuhn, 2001 ) and also were mixed with microblades. Considering the fact that no true Levallois technique has been observed in China and Korea ( Norton, 2000 , Gao and Norton, 2002  and  Norton, 2007 ), it is unknown at present why the Levallois technique apparently did not move further south from Inner Mongolia, while blade technology did. The route of diffusion of the blade technology from Inner Mongolia is not easy to reconstruct due to the lack of proper evidence between the Korean peninsula and Inner Mongolia. No early blade stone industry has been observed in northeast China. As is the case in North Korea, much future intensive research is required in this region including northeast China and Inner Mongolia. The current evidence from Korea indicates that blade technology diffused in a relatively short time to the northeastern part of China and the Korean peninsula. However, it did not replace the conventional types of tools on vein quartz or quartzite but coexisted along with them, as seen at some sites such as Hopyeong ( Hong and Kim, 2008 ).
4. Migration of modern humans and patterns of the Upper Paleolithic industries

Current human fossil evidence is hardly expected to provide any clue for the migration of modern humans into the Korean peninsula. Not many human fossils have been found in the Korean peninsula because of strong soil acidity ( Norton, 2000 ;; Park and Lee, 2003 ). With the exception of some fragmentary hominin fossils from sites in the southern part of the peninsula, most human fossils were found in limestone caves in North Korea ( Chang, 2002 ). The hominin fossils from cultural layer 2 of Yonggok cave near Pyoungyang was dated to 44 300 ± 2000 a and 49 900 ± 2000 a by Uranium-series dating ( Kim, 1991 , Laboratory of Human Evolution, 1995  and  Han, 2008 ). These fossils show derived characters similar to modern humans. However, it was found in association with crude stone artefacts on vein quartz without any blade elements. In the Rangjeonggol cave, fragments of hominins were found in association with some crude stone artefacts. The fossils were dated between 52 000 BP and 43 000 BP by several different methods. The Mandal Man, a fully developed anatomically modern man which is considered an ancestor of modern Korean people by North Korean archaeologists, was found with obsidian microlithic industry ( Chang, 2002 ). It is the only hominin fossil that is associated with Upper Paleolithic stone industry. However, fossil evidence in the peninsula is simply not sufficient to discuss the origin of modern humans in Korea.

Both blade industries and traditional core and flake stone artefacts were present in the Upper Paleolithic in Korea. The question that arises is why Korean Upper Paleolithic peoples did not fully adopt blade technology, but, in some instances, retained core and flake tool types despite being less efficient. Does this pattern imply local evolution of blade technology, as several archaeologists have claimed (e.g., Lee, 2005 , Seong, 2006a  and  Seong, 2006b )?

The two different tool types are not likely to have been used by different groups of people. Some industries consist of purely traditional tool types on coarse quartzite or vein quartz, for example those industries from the upper layer of the Chongokni site ( Bae et al., 2001 ). In other cases, these stone industries appeared in a mosaic pattern and were mixed in assemblages. For example, both types were found in the same layer of the Hopyeong-dong site ( Hong and Kim, 2008 ).

Why did the foraging groups who brought blade technology into the peninsula not develop it to the full? They might have adapted to the local environment in the peninsula by adopting the conventional technology of tool production instead of retaining their own tool making tradition of producing blades. Traditional core and flake tools might have been efficient enough in the environment of the Korean peninsula during the latter part of the Late Pleistocene (unlike Siberia). Furthermore, locating proper raw materials for making blades may have been more costly than simply using conventional tools along with blade tools. However, the optimal adaptation process of raw materials may not be enough to eliminate the question of why functional dominance of blade technology over traditional tools on coarse material did not appear in a general sense. Therefore, another question that needs addressing is why blade technology was not any more extensively developed after its introduction, as occurred in Siberia, in spite of the potential increase in efficiency throughout the Upper Paleolithic? Why could even much developed microblade technology not penetrate further south in China beyond the southern boundary of blade technology?

The possibility of continual influx of culture from the southern part of mainland China can be considered, along with other possible explanations such as local continuation of culture and local adaptation. It is quite likely that migration of modern humans from the southern part of mainland China continued during the late Late Pleistocene into the Korean peninsula, as in late prehistory. Foraging groups in southern China had only conventional tools throughout the Paleolithic Age ( Wang, 1997 , Wang, 2004  and  Matsufuji, 2003 ). Flake-based stone industries in the southern part of China would have provided modern humans sufficient tools to survive in the region, even during the Last Glacial Maximum. Population growth would have been sufficient to extend to the Hwanghe river basin, where the southern boundary of blade technology lies, and possibly further north. No element of blade technology has been observed in the Upper Paleolithic industries from Zhoukoudian upper cave ( Zhang and Pei, 1985  and  Norton and Gao, 2008 ) and Xiaogushan in northeastern China.

Humans likely migrated into the Korean peninsula through the exposed Yellow Sea basin during glacial periods, continuously bringing their flake-based stone industries to the peninsula, mixing with blade stone industries. However, the environment was probably not so severe for those populations from both directions to change their technology during the early stage of Upper Paleolithic, and even in the late part of the Upper Paleolithic when they frequently used blade-based stone industries and microblade stone industries. The ‘heterogenic’ pattern of stone industries is often explained as conservatism in tool production in the Upper Paleolithic Age in Korea. However, persistence over such a long time as a general pattern needs another model of explanation. This ‘North–South model’ of Upper Paleolithic pattern in East Asia might even be helpful to explain why no true Levallois technique has been observed in mainland China and Korea. At the time of the ‘Middle Paleolithic’, the northern boundary of the flake-based industries moved northward and was probably dominant in most of China and Korea, even in northern China. This is not simply a cultural pattern, but a representation of direction of human migration at that time. Homo sapiens or modern humans with flake-based tools, but without any Levallois technique, possibly expanded their territory further north in the ‘Middle Paleolithic’.

Further evidence may be needed to support this idea, such as comparative analysis of stone industries and human fossils. However, the current general pattern of distribution of blade stone industries in this region and two eastward migration routes of modern Homo sapiens in the Eurasian continent should be considered as concrete grounds for the explanation of the ‘heterogenic’ origin of the Upper Paleolithic industries in the Korean peninsula ( Fig. 4 ). In the north, a group of modern humans brought blade technology via Altai and Mongolia to the Korean peninsula, while another group of people from southern China migrated to the peninsula with conventional industries lacking blade technology. The North–South model of Upper Paleolithic migrations could also be supported by the general pattern of Paleolithic industries in the Japanese archipelago. In the early stage of the Upper Paleolithic, two different tool technologies have been proposed in the northern and southern parts of the Japanese archipelago. Well developed blade-based stone industries appeared in northeastern Japan, while flake-based stone industries are common in southwestern Japan ( Sato, 2008 ).

It has been a common understanding that modern Homo came into the Korean peninsula from Siberia not only in the historical period but even in the Upper Pleistocene. However, modern human migration from southern China to northeast China or even to the Korean peninsula has also been proposed by Chinese geneticists on the basis of the analysis of Y-chromosomes ( Hong et al., 2005 ). According to the analysis, the O3-M122 haplotype is believed to have originated from southern East Asia, due to a higher frequency of polymorphisms than in northeastern Asia. Hong et al. (2005) concluded that early northward migration of the O3-M122 lineage in East Asia occurred 30 000–25 000 BP. Regardless of the time of the early boundary, this genetic study of modern Asians supports anatomically modern human migration from southern China toward the Korean Peninsula and northeastern China during the late part of the Upper Paleolithic, which provides support for the ‘North and South model’ of human migrations with different Paleolithic cultures. Previous genetic studies also support the theory that the prevailing gene flow had been in a south-to-north direction before the Holocene when bidirectional gene flow possibly occurred ( Karafet et al., 2001  and  Su et al., 1999 ).
5. Conclusion

The ‘heterogenic’ origin of the Upper Paleolithic industries in the Korean peninsula can be explained by the “North and South model” of modern human migrations. Modern humans dispersing from western Siberia toward Mongolia and eastern Siberia brought blade technology to the Korean peninsula and also to the northern part of the Japanese archipelago, while modern human populations equipped with conventional flake industries from southern China continually migrated toward the northeastern part of East Asia, including the Korean peninsula. Migrations of modern human populations of the two origins were merged in the Korean peninsula and resulted in the heterogenic Upper Paleolithic cultures. These migrations were not punctuated but continuous during the latter part of the Late Pleistocene. It may not be easy to find some relevant archaeological evidence supporting the human migration from the south, because of the expedient nature of stone industries in this region.

The mixture of the two quite different technologies cannot be explained by mixtures of modern humans with those of the previous evolutionary stage as suggested by some Korean archaeologists. Rather, different modern human populations with different cultures came to the peninsula and kept their tool making tradition for a time after their arrival, along with maintaining the local tradition of tool making. Population influx from the south might have been much greater than that from the north into the Korean peninsula and conventional flake-based industries prevailed even in the late period, although blade technology was more frequent and dominant in particular assemblages. Northward migration from southern China during the late Upper Pleistocene is supported by genetic analysis of the modern population's Y-chromosome in this area. This model of human migration may be helpful to our understanding of the Upper Paleolithic patterns in the Japanese archipelago where blade technology was absent in the southwestern part of the archipelago in the early stage of the Upper Paleolithic until blade technology was diffused in the later period.

The region between the Korean peninsula and Inner Mongolia needs to be investigated to better understand the movement of modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic. However, the Korean blade technology is believed to have moved from the north, quite possibly via Inner Mongolia where the Shuidonggou site is situated. At present, blade technology is considered to have been introduced into the peninsula at a time evidently earlier than 30 000 BP and possibly 35 000 BP. It is interesting to note that microblade technology expanded further south than blade technologies in China, possibly due to climatic factors, but never reached South China.

    Australian Archaeology
    Description: Australian Archaeology , the official publication of the Australian Archaeological Association Inc., is a refereed journal published since 1974. It accepts original articles in all fields of archaeology and other subjects relevant to archaeological research and practice in Australia and nearby areas. Contributions are accepted in seven sections: Articles (5000-8000 words), Short Reports (1000-3000), Obituaries (500-2000), Thesis Abstracts (200-500), Book Reviews (500-2000), Comment (1000) and Backfill (which includes letters, conference details, announcements and other material of interest to members). Australian Archaeology is published twice a year, in June and December. Notes to Contributors are available at www.australianarchaeologicalassociation.com.au .
    Coverage: 1974-2012 (No. 1 - No. 75)

        Moving Wall: 2 years (What is the moving wall?)

        Moving Wall

            The "moving wall" represents the time period between the last issue available in JSTOR and the most recently published issue of a journal. Moving walls are generally represented in years. In rare instances, a publisher has elected to have a "zero" moving wall, so their current issues are available in JSTOR shortly after publication.
            Note: In calculating the moving wall, the current year is not counted.
            For example, if the current year is 2008 and a journal has a 5 year moving wall, articles from the year 2002 are available.

            Terms Related to the Moving Wall
                Fixed walls: Journals with no new volumes being added to the archive.
                Absorbed: Journals that are combined with another title.
                Complete: Journals that are no longer published or that have been combined with another title.

Abstract
Our understanding of flaked stone artefacts from assemblages in mainland Southeast Asia is constrained by a shortage of robust and flexible theory to generate suitable methods of analysis. I review three candidate theories derived from Darwinian evolutionary principles to identify the most suitable for investigating flaked stone artefacts from mainland Southeast Asia. The demands of the theory are compared with the evidential constraints of the assemblages. Human behavioural ecology is found to be the most suitable because of the reliable methods available to test predictions with artefact assemblages. A small case study is discussed to demonstrate the applicability of this approach.

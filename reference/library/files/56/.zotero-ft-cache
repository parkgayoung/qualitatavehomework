Abstract

Archaeologists are increasingly concerned that the non-linear relationship between the calendric and radiocarbon timelines may introduce anomalous structures into radiocarbon-supported temporal frequency distributions ( tfd s) – time series data describing temporal fluctuations in the frequency of archaeological, paleontological, or other geological deposits. This concern emphasizes a need for improved middle range theory on tfd formation, addressing the interaction between several stochastic processes. This paper outlines a Monte Carlo simulation designed to explore the influence of several variables on tfd morphology, including the nonlinear calendric-to-radiocarbon age relationship. The results indicate that this non-linear relationship entails greater variance between identically generated tfd s over some temporal intervals than others but does not predictably lead to tfd peaks over these intervals as previously suggested. Additional variance between identically generated tfd s results from small sample sizes and high values in the underlying TFD . Smoothing the tfd is a solution not only to calibration curve interference but also to sample size-dependent sampling error.

1. Introduction

In the wake of Paul Ehrlich's The Population Bomb (1968), a dystopian treatise on human overpopulation, demographers and population ecologists have paid sustained attention to the population growth dynamics of our species, as well as their implications for past, present, and future well-being ( Bloom, 2011 , Coale, 1974 , Cohen, 1995  and  Ellison et al., 2012 : 757–759; Gerland et al., 2014 , Hirschman, 2005 , Lee and Tuljapurkar, 2008 , Lee et al., 2009 , Puleston and Tuljapurkar, 2008  and  Rogers, 1992 ). Both population size and growth factor among the chief concerns of demographic and population ecological inquiry ( Chamberlain, 2006 : 2, 2009: 275–276; Hassan, 1981 : 1–2; Micklin and Poston, 2005 : 2; Newell, 1988 : 3; Preston et al., 2001 : 1–16; Skalski et al., 2005 : 11), and consequently foundational texts in these fields devote considerable attention to the discussion of methods for describing and estimating population size and growth ( Newell, 1988 : 8–9; Preston et al., 2001 : 1–16; Skalski et al., 2005 : 11–15, 289–296); for formalizing the connections between population growth and other topics of demographic concern (e.g., population composition and the age pattern of vital events; Preston et al., 2001 : 138–190; Skalski et al., 2005 : 26–37); and for fitting population growth models to empirical data and projecting such models into hypothetical futures ( Preston et al., 2001 : 117–137; Skalski et al., 2005 : 15–26, 297–322).

Our ability to identify changes in the size of past populations is relevant to a diverse range of research topics in archaeological and paleontological research, including the identification of colonization and extirpation processes, factors promoting or undercutting the ecological foothold of species, and causality in sociopolitical and economic change and in cultural diffusion and transmission. Over the last four decades, this need has increasingly been met by using temporal frequency distributions ( tfd s) – time series data describing temporal variation in the abundance of archaeological or fossil deposits ( Fig. 1 ) – as proxy census records, or at minimum as records of occupation intensity or presence/absence (see Chamberlain, 2006 : 131–132, 2009: 280). Most regions of the world have been subjected to such demographic temporal frequency analysis (dTFA), to varying degrees ( Table 1 ).

Research questions addressed in the framework of dTFA have varied widely in temporal scale, focusing on both long-run population processes and relatively brief episodes of demographic change. Among the latter, Maschner and colleagues (2009b : 38–41) have recently applied dTFA to the evaluation of a population replacement model of the Kachemak–Koniag transition in the Kodiak Archipelago, Gulf of Alaska, approximately 900–700 cal BP ( Clark, 1998 , Fitzhugh, 2003 , Maschner et al., 2009b , Mills, 1994 , Saltonstall and Steffian, 2006  and  West, 2011 ). This cultural change involved the appearance of ceramic technology; a transition from single-to multi-room pit houses; an explosion in typical site size; intensified usage of river corridors and a corresponding increase in the freshwater fishery; changes in symbolic expressions and mortuary practices, likely relating to changes in social and belief systems and ritual practices; and the establishment of institutionalized sociopolitical inequality. A number of archaeologists working in the region have proposed population continuity across this cultural transition and explained it as a process of gradual in situ change ( Jordan and Knecht, 1988 , Knecht, 1995  and  Saltonstall and Steffian, 2006 ), perhaps with exogenous influence from a small number of immigrants or other long-distance contacts ( Clark, 1988 , Clark, 1992 , Clark, 1998  and  Fitzhugh, 2003 ). In contrast, as a component of a synthetic ecological model of cultural and demographic processes spanning the Northeast Pacific Rim, Maschner et al. (2009b) have argued that a dTFA of archaeological site occupations from Kodiak supports Dumond, 1965 , Dumond, 1987 , Dumond, 1988 , Dumond, 1991  and  Dumond, 2005 earlier model of cultural change driven by demographic disruption and replacement, in which Kachemak populations largely abandoned the region and were subsequently replaced by Koniag immigrants (see also Hrdlička, 1944 ). The most striking feature of Maschner and colleagues' dTFA is an alleged paucity of sites during the century 850–750 cal BP, though a closer inspection of their tfd s ( Fig. 1 , adapted from Maschner et al., 2009b : Fig. 3.5.) instead suggests that this paucity came the following century.

Yet, as interest in dTFA grows, archaeologists are also increasingly aware of the approach's limitations and the need to identify the conditions and constraints on its valid pursuit. In response, researchers now strive for a more explicit, comprehensive, and sufficiently compelling body of middle range theory (MRT) to support and regulate dTFA, one that outlines the system of transformations through which paleopopulation size curves pass in the process of becoming archaeological or paleontological tfd s. This effort, outlined in Section 1.1 , has been underway since Rick's (1987) article on the population dynamics of pre-ceramic Peru and will likely continue for some time. This paper focuses on one aspect of this work, the unique challenges that confront dTFA supported by radiocarbon ( 14 C) age estimation (Section 1.2 ).
1.1. The MRT of dTFA

The validity of dTFA rests on the proposition that larger populations tend to discard a greater abundance of materials than do smaller ones ( Rick, 1987 ). By implication, tfd s generated from samples of time-stamped archaeological or paleontological deposits should track temporal variation in past population size, all else being equal.

Of course, all else is rarely equal. Rick (1987) qualified this strong assumption almost as soon as he articulated it, identifying a number of potential confounding factors each warranting dedicated efforts at mitigation or control. In the two and a half decades following Rick's article, disputed interpretations have become a standard in dTFA, one of the most recent and heated arising in response to Buchanan and colleagues' (2008) rejection of a Paleoindian population response to the hypothetical Younger Dryas (YD) extraterrestrial impact event (see Anderson et al., 2008 , Bamforth and Grund, 2012 , Buchanan et al., 2011 , Collard et al., 2008 , Culleton, 2008 , Firestone et al., 2007 , Jones, 2008 , Kennett and West, 2008 , Kennett et al., 2008 , Steele, 2010  and  Weninger et al., 2011 ).

General factors confounding dTFA can be divided between those that introduce systematic error into the population size estimate and those that introduce random error ( Table 2 ).

1.2. Systematic and random error and non-demographic structures in 14 C-supported tfds

Special issues in dTFA arise when archaeologists or paleontologists depend on 14 C age-stamped samples for their analysis. In this case, two additional factors become relevant: secular variation in the concentration of atmospheric 14 C ( Sonett and Finney, 1990 ), and instrument measurement error ( Walker, 2005 ), each entailing unique computational demands for tfd construction and analysis. These demands have increasingly been met by 14 C age calibration and the construction of summed probability distributions ( spd s). 1 With this type of tfd , the probability density characterizing each probabilistic age estimate in the sample is summed at each location along the timeline:
equation ( 1 )
View the MathML source View the MathML source u ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 n f i ( t )
Turn   MathJax on
where u ( t ) is the sum of all units' probabilistic age estimates at time t and f i ( t ) is the probability density for the i th data point in the sample at time t . In effect, spd s provide a best guess regarding the temporal frequency of a sample of units, given the uncertainty that characterizes 14 C-based age estimation.

Fig. 2 presents a spd comprising 166 site occupations from Kodiak. Data were compiled by the present author, updating previous databases compiled by Haggarty, Erlandson, and colleagues ( Erlandson et al., 1992  and  Haggarty et al., 1991 ), Mills (1994) , and Fitzhugh (2003) . Dates excluded from analysis include strictly geologic dates; modern dates and dates reported without lab error; dates lacking sufficient contextual information to evaluate their archaeological validity; dates widely dismissed by archaeologists working in the region; and dates on marine fauna or suspected marine fauna. For each site in the sample, clusters of insignificantly different age estimates were pooled following the method proposed by Ward and Wilson (1978) , to minimize the overrepresentation of intensively dated sites. It is worth noting that Maschner and colleagues' tfd ( Fig. 1 ) resembles the spd shown in Fig. 2 in broad outline, as well as in several details, and particularly the brief paucity of sites 750–650 cal BP.

While 14 C age calibration and the use of spd s are regarded as best practices in 14 C-supported dTFA, the spd s they generate unfortunately exhibit anomalous peak-and-trough structures arising from several recognized sources of error:

1.

    Sampling error. tfd s, including spd s, are sample distributions and as such approximate the shape of their underlying probability distribution ( TFD ) imperfectly. Fig. 3 illustrates the morphological disparities standing between a truncated exponential TFD and a tfd of 200 observations randomly drawn from it. Anomalous gaps and concentrations between observations are evident in the rug plot expression of the tfd , as indicated in the quantile–quantile plot ( Fig. 3 :C), informing the artificial peaks, valleys, and plateaus observed in both the histogram ( Fig. 3 :A) and kernel density estimate (KDE; Fig. 3 :B). The influence of sampling error on tfd shape has been explored by Michczyńska and colleagues ( Michczyńska and Pazdur, 2004  and  Michczyńska et al., 2003 ), Williams, 2012  and  Armit et al., 2013 , Rhode and colleagues (in press), and Contreras and Meadows (in press) and is also apparent in Bartlein and colleagues' (1995: Fig. 2 ) uncalibrated tfd simulations.

    Dispersive calendric-to- 14 C age mapping. Each calendric age corresponds with a range of possible 14 C ages rather than a single point. For example, the calendric age 12,000 cal BP corresponds with a range of 14 C ages specified as N (10,237, 47) by IntCal13 ( Reimer et al., 2013 ). Figs. 4 :A and 5: A illustrate the disparities that arise between 14 C ages having an identical calendric age of 12,000 cal BP.

Dispersive mapping for the true age 12,000 cal BP follows the distribution rcyBP ∼ N ( μ  = 10,237,  σ  = 47) per IntCal13 ( Reimer et al., 2013 ), with an instrument measurement offset following a normal distribution specified as N ( μ  = 0, σ  = 50).

B : Distribution of measured 14 C ages for the same 10,000 observations as in Fig. 5 :A. Simulated measurement error follows the normal model specified as offset ∼ N ( μ  = 0, σ    = 50).

    Instrument measurement error. As is true in the measurement sciences in general, the instruments employed in 14 C age measurement entail random error that obscures the true 14 C age of dated specimens. As a result, even repeated measurements on a single specimen may produce disparate estimates. This instrument measurement error interacts with dispersive calendric-to- 14 C age mapping to further extend the range of 14 C ages corresponding with any given calendric age, leading to a propagation of error. In Fig. 4 :A, the true 14 C ages of all three simulated observations have each been offset by a value following a normal distribution specified as N (0, 50). Fig. 5 :B shows the distribution of 10,000 measured 14 C ages corresponding with the true 14 C ages shown in Fig. 5 :A, robustly illustrating the pattern that emerges from this propagation of error. Importantly, when the three age estimates shown in Fig. 4 :A are calibrated ( Fig. 4 :B), it becomes clear that the probabilistic calendric age estimates from which spd s are generated can be profoundly dislocated by this propagation of error. Bamforth and Grund, 2012 , Armit et al., 2013 , Kerr and McCormick, 2014  and  Wicks and Mithen, 2014 , and Contreras and Meadows (in press) have incorporated this propagation of error into their simulation studies using OxCal's R_Simulate function ( Bronk Ramsey, 2009a ,b). In fact, this effect accounts entirely for the differences observed between two identically generated spd s in Bamforth and Grund's (2012 : Fig. 1 ) study in the absence of sampling error. McFadgen et al. (1994) have also explored the influence of instrument measurement error on tfd morphology.
4.

    Calibration interference. Calibration as it is currently implemented involves mapping the entire probability distribution associated with a 14 C age estimate through the calibration curve into calendric time. In the process, the shape, location, and scale of the distribution are transformed. Because the shape of the calibration curve varies over time, the degree to which these three distributional properties are transformed likewise varies along the timeline ( Guilderson et al., 2005 , Pazdur and Michczyńska, 1989 , Steier et al., 2001 , Stuiver and Reimer, 1989 , Stuiver and Reimer, 1993 , Weninger, 1986  and  Weninger et al., 2011 ). Fig. 6 illustrates this time-variant effect. While the shape and scale of two probability distributions is identical along the 14 C timeline, their respective expressions along the calendric timeline is notably disparate: the younger calendric estimate is more precise than its corresponding, uncalibrated counterpart and is also asymmetrical, whereas the older calendric estimate is not only more diffuse than its uncalibrated counterpart but also shows multiple, asymmetrically distributed modes. The influence of this error on the shape of 14 C-supported tfd s has been explored by McFadgen et al. (1994) , Michczyńska and colleagues ( Michczyńska and Pazdur, 2004  and  Michczyńska et al., 2003 ), Williams, 2012 , Bamforth and Grund, 2012  and  Armit et al., 2013 , Kerr and McCormick (2014) , Wicks and Mithen (2014) , and Contreras and Meadows (in press) .

In effect, these four sources of error entail a potential to introduce structural equifinalities into the shape of the tfd , with some structures representing real demographic processes and others false ones. At the same time, the appearance of real demographic structures may be dampened by both systematic and random error.

In response to this potential for error, a handful of simulation experiments have been conducted to explore the influence of one ( Bartlein et al., 1995 ; Rhode et al., in press), two ( McFadgen et al., 1994 , Michczyńska and Pazdur, 2004  and  Williams, 2012 ), or three ( Bamforth and Grund, 2012 ; Kerr and McCormick, 2014 ; Wicks and Mithen, 2014 ) of these sources of error. However, exploring the interaction of all four factors has only recently begun ( Armit et al., 2013  and  Contreras and Meadows, 2014 . In addition, the robustness of these experiments has for the most part been limited by unfavorably small simulation sizes, involving either the characterization of a single simulation run ( Armit et al., 2013 , Bamforth and Grund, 2012 , Bartlein et al., 1995 , Contreras and Meadows, 2014 , Kerr and McCormick, 2014 , McFadgen et al., 1994  and  Wicks and Mithen, 2014 ) or comparisons of between two and one hundred runs (two: Bamforth and Grund, 2012 ; five: Contreras and Meadows, in press ; ten: Armit et al., 2013 ; thirty: Williams, 2012 ; one hundred: Rhode et al., in press). Michczyńska and colleagues' Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, based on 10,000 runs, are the noteworthy exceptions ( Michczyńska and Pazdur, 2004  and  Michczyńska et al., 2003 ).

The next section presents a general framework for a flexible MC simulation designed to address these critical gaps. It begins by considering the motivation for and properties of effective MC simulations. Section 3 presents the results of two permutations of this approach, highlighting the influence of size-dependent sampling error and TFD shape on inter-run tfd variability.
2. A MC simulation approach
2.1. Motivation, goals, and ideal properties of MC simulations

Frequently, modeling complex systems of causal relationships eludes closed-form expression, inhibiting the possibility of predicting their outcomes through analytical solution ( Roberts and Casella, 2004 , Rubinstein and Kroese, 2008  and  Thomopoulos, 2013 ). This is true, for example, when the output follows an unknown probability distribution that combines the effects of separate but interacting stochastic processes, each governed by its own data generating process (DGP). In the context of 14 C-supported dTFA, exploring the combined influence of three stochastic processes – random sampling, calendric-to- 14 C-age mapping, and instrument measurement error – on the shape of spd s provides a case in point. This compound DGP, in combination with the complicated transformation entailed by calibration, render any effort to infer the spd expression of a known TFD analytically intractable.

When analytical solutions cannot be obtained for problems such as this, MC simulation offers a means of approximating the solution within a reasonable degree of uncertainty. Customarily, MC simulations conform to the following, general procedure:

1.

    Design an algorithm that

    a.

        automates the passage of output from earlier components of the system to later ones;
    b.

        dictates realistic functional relationships, whether deterministic or probabilistic, between each component's input and output variables;

2.

    Hold certain variables in the model system constant while allowing others to vary within meaningful limits;
3.

    Initialize the simulation by generating a large set of random observations and passing them through the algorithm, recording the final output for each pass (as well as intermediate outcomes, if of interest);
4.

    Calculate one or more summary statistics for the set of outcomes and treat these as approximations for the elusive analytical solution. Such statistics are labeled ‘plug-in estimators,’ to distinguish them from both their analytic counterparts and ordinary sample statistics. Plug-in estimators may include single-point values (e.g., mean, median, variance, percentiles) or entire sample distributions (e.g., histograms, KDEs).

With large enough sample sizes, MC plug-in estimators take advantage of the Law of Large Numbers (LLN), which states that sample statistics should converge toward their underlying parameters as sample size increases ( Christian and Casella, 2010 ). In practice, the efficiency with which computers can generate random numbers allows for the implementation of incredibly large simulations and consequently very precise plug-in estimators.

However, when sample size is itself a parameter of interest in the model system, as it is when sampling error exerts a major influence on the shape of a sample distribution, variation reduction is no longer the goal of the simulation. Rather, exploring the influence of sample size on variation between samples becomes an analytical target. Even in this case, however, achieving a robust and precise estimate of variation between samples requires the simulation of a large set of samples, warranting a two-step elaboration on the basic MC framework:

1.

    Generate a single run of random inputs, manipulating sample size rather than favoring a large one, and calculate the plug-in estimator(s) of interest from its output;
2.

    Repeat the first step a large number of times, collecting plug-in estimator(s) of interest from each run, then calculate second-order, inter-run estimators from the collection of per-run estimators. This is the MC equivalent to solving for the parameters of an unknown sampling distribution.

2.2. Simulating variation between 14 C spds

Past simulation studies exploring 14 C spd s have emphasized the influence of several variables on spd morphology. These include the shape, scale, and location of the underlying TFD (assuming for the sake of argument that this is proportional to the population size curve, N ( t )); sample size in a random sampling framework; the shape of the 14 C-to-calendric-age curve (i.e., the calibration curve), used for both calendric-to- 14 C-age translation and subsequent calibration; and the magnitude of instrument measurement error ( Armit et al., 2013 , Bamforth and Grund, 2012 , Bartlein et al., 1995 , Contreras and Meadows, 2014 , Kerr and McCormick, 2014 , McFadgen et al., 1994  and  Michczyńska and Pazdur, 2004 ; Rhode et al., in press; Wicks and Mithen, 2014  and  Williams, 2012 ).

The main constraint on most of these past simulations' ability to achieve robust estimators of inter-run variance has been a lack of automation, often requiring the researchers themselves to transfer output from one computing environment to another, as well as performing some of the simulation steps by hand. For example, Bamforth and Grund (2012) recorded the true ages of their simulated samples in an unspecified environment, then passed these to OxCal 3.10 and 4.1 to translate them into offset 14 C age estimates, and finally passed these to CALIB 5.1 and 6.0 to generate spd s. Similarly, Williams (2012) resampled from an extensive database of archaeological 14 C dates in an unspecified environment and generated one spd per run in OxCal 4.1, for 210 separate runs. Contreras and Meadows (in press) digitized realistic TFD s with Plot Digitizer, generated random samples of varying size from these using an algorithm in R, and passed these to OxCal 4.2.3 to translate them into offset 14 C age estimates and calibrate them. This constraint has been due in large part to archaeologists' dependence on one of the major calibration programs – OxCal, CALIB, or CalPal – to generate 14 C spd s. Fortunately, such dependence is not compulsory, as Shennan et al. (2013) have demonstrated, and the potential power that we might hope to achieve by conducting simulation studies of spd formation in a single computing environment is well-illustrated by Michczyńska and colleagues' [2004] unparalleled 10,000-run simulation in GdCALIB. The free availability of the R programming language now puts the potential for fully automated, single-environment simulations at the fingertips of archaeologists. Such well-integrated simulation studies would take the researcher out of the process save for in choosing how to manipulate the parameters of interest. This could result in a vast improvement in simulation efficiency and a significant reduction in user error.

The following presents the general framework of a MC algorithm, implemented in R and designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the experimental manipulation of those parameters listed above. In general, the DGP underlying this algorithm combines the following elements 2 :

•

    A set of runs is generated, each run comprising a sample of observations randomly drawn from an identical TFD. Each observation simulates the true calendric age of a single unit of observation (as in Fig. 3 ):

•

    Measured 14 C ages are calibrated according to an algorithm similar to that used by OxCal, CALIB, and most recently Shennan et al. (2013) . (For debate regarding the merits of different calibration algorithms, see Buchanan et al., 2011 ; Culleton, 2008 , Steele, 2010  and  Weninger et al., 2011 .) Once calibrated, the probability distributions for all observations in a single run are then summed per Eq. (1) , then rescaled so that the area under the spd sums to 1.
•

    Plug-in estimators are calculated summarizing the distributional properties of all runs' spd values at five-year intervals along the calendric timeline.

To demonstrate the utility and flexibility of this MC framework, I focus here on an experiment exploring the combined influence of calibration interference, sampling error, and TFD shape on spd morphology. The eight sample sizes considered ( n  = 30, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000) span a range typical for studies in dTFA. The two TFD s considered (a uniform and an exponentially increasing TFD ) are both truncated at 7500 and 0 cal BP to address the range of time covered by Kodiak's known occupation history (see Fig. 1  and  Fig. 2 ). These TFD morphologies simulate a stationary population and a stable population growing at a constant rate of approximately 0.7064 people per thousand people per year, respectively. As previous researchers have observed ( Bartlein et al., 1995 , McFadgen et al., 1994  and  Bamforth and Grund, 2012 ), the uniform distribution affords an ideal means of demonstrating the intrusion of artificial structures into tfd s, given its structureless morphology. A single calibration curve is considered (IntCal13; Reimer et al., 2013 ). Finally, a single value for instrument measurement error was considered (50 14 C years), approximating the median and mean standard errors for the set of Kodiak dates illustrated in Fig. 2 .

For each sample size and TFD , 2000 runs were generated per Eq. (2) , for a total of 32,000 runs processed. With a maximum sample size of 2000 observations per run and two TFD s considered, 8 million individual age estimates were generated in total. Each observation was mapped onto the 14 C timeline and offset per Eqs. (3)  and  (4) , then calibrated. All observations per run were summed per Eq. (1) and rescaled so that the area under each spd sums to 1, in other words such that each spd comprises a time series of sample proportions. The inter-run mean sample proportion and four percentiles (2.5%, 25%, 75%, and 97.5%) were calculated at five-year intervals along the calendric timeline.

First, the inter-run mean of sample proportions closely approximates the underlying TFD , as expected given the LLN and the 2000 runs per simulation. However, two departures from this pattern are worth noting, one at each end of the model TFD :

•

    Lower-than-expected inter-run means are indicated toward the earlier end of each distribution, resulting from the dispersive random error introduced by 14 C age translation and instrument offset. In effect, this dispersion has led to the extension of spd sample mass beyond the sharply defined limit of the underlying TFD.
•

    A high degree of random error in the inter-run mean of sample proportions, as well as in their percentiles, is indicated over the last 500 years of each distribution. Williams (2012) noted similarly high variance in his bootstrap samples for the same temporal interval. This period of heightened inter-run variability is likely a result of the marked increase in precision of the calibration curve over this interval ( Fig. 9 ), which would act not only to decrease the dispersion evident in the mapping of calendric into 14 C ages (Eq. (3) ) but also to increase the precision of calibrated age estimates' probability distributions (as in Fig. 6 ).

Second, the magnitude of variation between runs decreases as sample size increases, converging toward the underlying TFD , as expected given the LLN. However, for small and even moderate sample sizes, the lower percentile boundaries fall at or hover slightly above 0. For the uniform TFD simulations, the lower 25% boundary has lifted away only by n  = 100 and the 2.5% boundary only by n  = 200. A similar pattern holds for the exponential TFD simulations, although the earlier end of the curve remains low in response to the low TFD values at this point. Additionally, the inter-run mean falls above the 75% boundary near the early end of the exponential TFD simulation at n  = 30.

Third, in the case of the exponential TFD simulations, the dispersion of sample proportions generally increases as the mass of the underlying TFD value increases, producing the curved wedge shape characterizing the percentile boundaries shown in Fig. 8 . A similar pattern should be expected for any TFD exhibiting departures from uniform shape over the timeline. Fig. 10 illustrates spd s for two simulation runs ( n  = 200) out of the 2000 illustrated in Fig. 8 . Here it is worth noting that, while both spd s are the products of an identical DGP, their inter-run disparities are greatest toward the later, higher-density end of the underlying TFD .

Fourth, the fluctuations observed in the percentile estimators over time indicate positional stability across simulations, this pattern being particularly obvious in the uniform TFD simulations ( Fig. 7 ). Furthermore, these fluctuations appear to correspond with fluctuations in the average calibration curve slope, as already noted by Michczyńska and Pazdur (2004) and as observed in Fig. 11 . On this point, a revision of previous statements about the nature of calibration interference is warranted (see Bamforth and Grund, 2012 , McFadgen et al., 1994  and  Williams, 2012 ). Temporal intervals characterized by steep calibration curve slopes do not always exhibit anomalously high sample proportions but rather a greater range of variability between spd s, on both sides of the underlying TFD value. In effect, the positional stability of high- and low-variability intervals is an artifact of calibration interference (as in Fig. 6 ), whereas their direction and magnitude constitute random error stemming from the combined operation of sampling error (as in Fig. 3 ) and the dispersive transformation of true calendric ages into measured 14 C age estimates (as in Fig. 4 :A).

4. Discussion

The results of the MC simulations presented here reinforce previous simulation-based impressions (1) that the nonlinear relationship between the calendric and 14 C timelines introduces artificial, time-dependent structures into spd s, and (2) that it is difficult to distinguish between true demographic structures and non-demographic ones in small-sample tfd s, including spd s. These observations recommend against any attempt to address hypotheses about short-run demographic processes through 14 C-supported dTFA, particularly when working with modest sample sizes. Simply put, the tfd s that such analyses produce are too sensitive to the various DGPs that generate them to validly influence our assessment of such high-resolution hypotheses. The disputed demographic dimension of the Kachemak–Koniag transition provides a case in point. On the one hand, a scarcity of site occupations during the century 750–650 cal BP is evident in tfd s based on what data are currently available ( Fig. 1  and  Fig. 2 ). On the other hand, a comparison of Fig. 10 :A and 10:B illustrates that even when two spd s are generated from an identical DGP, these will nevertheless exhibit idiosyncratic structures relative to their underlying TFD and disparate structures relative to each other. The first simulated spd ( Fig. 10 :B) exhibits a peak-trough-peak sequence over the interval 850 and 550 cal BP, resembling those structures observed in the Kodiak spd over the same interval ( Fig. 2 ), whereas the second simulation ( Fig. 10 :C) instead exhibits a dramatic increase over the same interval. Conversely, the underlying TFD shows stable and gradual growth over the same interval, proportional to a population growing at a constant rate. In short, assuming for the sake of argument that the exponentially increasing TFD in Fig. 10 is representative of population dynamics in Kodiak over the period of interest, its empirical expression should nevertheless be expected to exhibit structures consistent with alternative accounts, particularly given the modest sample size available for the region. In light of the multiple stochasticities that affect small-sample spd s, a suspension of judgment regarding the demographic dimension of the Kachemak–Koniag transition is warranted, reprising Mills' (1994) warning of two decades ago.

Cautionary tales notwithstanding, the patterns identified in Section 3 can also be used to inform our efforts to identify effective strategies for mitigating some of the non-demographic error, both systematic and random, that troubles spd s. To begin with, the observation that variation decreases as sample size increases is neither surprising nor novel. In the realm of dTFA, Chamberlain, 2006  and  Chamberlain, 2009 and Surovell and Brantingham (2007) have already insisted that tfd s can only be treated as robust approximations of their underlying TFD s given particularly large or dense samples. Even so, our sense of what qualifies as a large or dense sample has not yet been well-calibrated. As Michczyńska and Pazdur (2004) and Williams (2012) have warned, and as the above simulations reconfirm, marked structural disparities between pairs of spd s identically generated from the same TFD can be quite dramatic for sample sizes less than 200 to 500. By extension, we should expect the story to change as sample size increases. Consequently, we should embrace every opportunity to increase sample size as a means of increasing the robustness of our TFD estimations, when opportunities exist to conduct further field surveys or revisit museum collections.

While the relationship between spd morphology and calibration curve slope has long been recognized, descriptions of this systematic error have remained incomplete until now. Michczyńska and colleagues' assertion that “the influence of the shape of the calibration curve on the 95% confidence intervals is clearly visible” (2004: 739) lacks specificity, though it is powerfully illustrated in their Fig. 7 . Conversely, those statements that have been more specific (see Bamforth and Grund, 2012 , McFadgen et al., 1994  and  Williams, 2012 ) have also been mistaken in asserting that steep calibration curve slopes necessarily produce anomalously exaggerated peak structures in spd s whereas gradual slopes and plateaus dampen real peaks. We can now revise this understanding, recognizing that calibration interference manifests primarily as a time-dependent fluctuation in inter-run variance and that other stochastic processes determine whether this variance manifests as peaks or troughs. By implication, we should have greater confidence in the accuracy of spd morphology over those temporal intervals corresponding with low calibration curve slopes than those corresponding with high. For the range of time considered in this paper, Fig. 11 :B identifies several periods that are most reliable (green bars) and those that are least (blue bars). In particular, the latter half of the 5th millennium cal BP and the five centuries centering on 2500 cal BP are especially reliable, whereas the intervals 7500–7100; 6500–6200; 5600–5400; 2900–2750; and especially 1500–500 cal BP show the greatest inter-run variance. The last 500 years BP are erratic, this being a function of noticeably low variance in the calibration curve over this terminal period (see Fig. 9 ). That the Kachemak–Koniag transition transpired during a period characterized by pronounced inter-run spd variance once again recommends that we suspend judgment regarding the demographic information that our dTFA offers for this interval.

The solution to calibration interference recommended by Williams (2012) is to smooth out spd s with a moving average, using a bandwidth of 500 for the interval 0–11,000 cal BP or of 800 for 11,000–50,000 cal BP (see also Ozainne et al., 2014 , Peros et al., 2010  and  Shennan et al., 2013 ). This coarse-grained approach, already anticipated in McFadgen and colleagues' (1994) work, reverses the sorting of sample density that results from calibration. Of equal importance, although unrecognized by Williams, is that this smoothing method is operationally identical to kernel density estimation, a nonparametric method for estimating the probability density functions underlying samples ( Baxter and Beardah, 1997  and  Sheather, 2004 ). The goal of kernel density estimation is to achieve an optimal balance between the reduction of sampling error and the preservation of structures original to the underlying probability distribution. In the future, the MC framework presented here will be used to pursue optimized algorithms for kernel density estimation in spd -based dTFA. The application of such ‘objective’ algorithms would go far in neutralizing the potential for analytical duplicity ( Whallon's [1987] ‘sleights of hand’). Additionally, because kernel density estimation algorithms tend to adapt to sample size and density, their application would lessen the need to pursue larger samples, though at the expense of our ability to detect fine-grained structures such as that suggested by Maschner et al. (2009b) .

One approach to dTFA that has recently emerged is the measurement of proxy growth rate estimates from tfd curves ( Crema, 2012 , Collard et al., 2010b  and  Collard et al., 2010a ; Peros et al., 2010 ), analogous to the measurement of population growth from N ( t ) curves ( Preston et al., 2001  and  Skalski et al., 2005 ). Such measurements however require relatively precise N ( t ) estimates at two points along the curve, which are not easy to come by for paleopopulations. When N ( t ) estimates for paleopopulations are imprecise, an alternative approach suggested by Cohen (1995 : 77–78) is to calculate a range of plausible growth rates based on maxima and minima for the two N ( t ) values bracketing the interval of interest, if such information is available. Crema's (2012) estimation of the slope dynamics of a tfd comprising mid-Holocene Japanese housepits followed this general approach. The time-dependence of calibration interference once again suggests that if we are to derive growth rate estimates from spd s, the most accurate estimates will be for those intervals bracketed by ages exhibiting low inter-run variance (i.e., those designated by green bars in Fig. 11 ). The application of optimized KDEs should also improve the accuracy of such estimates.

Finally, while the simulations presented in this paper demonstrate that the four DGPs they model produce structures in individual spd s that mimic genuine demographic structures with worrisome regularity, it has been suggested elsewhere that the identification of temporally coincident structures between tfd s from adjacent study regions may be employed to cross-validate the demographic interpretation of such structures in each tfd included in the comparison ( Hinz et al., 2012  and  Maschner et al., 2009 : 48; Maschner, personal communication). Validation and identification of constraints on this approach await future exploration.

By design, the results of this MC experiment do not explore the influence of other model system parameters on variability between runs, particularly more dispersed TFD s and a greater or more variable degree of instrument measurement error. As suggested by Michczyńska and Pazdur (2004) and by Williams (2012) , variability in both of these parameters may warrant an adaptive approach to sample size threshold. Alternatively, an adaptive kernel density estimation algorithm could mitigate the effects of variability in these parameters. Similarly, the truncated uniform and exponential TFD s explored in this paper were chosen for their structural simplicity, enabling the straightforward identification of the non-demographic structures that emerge in spd s. Inputting more structurally complex TFD s into the MC simulation, which would emulate population size curves more realistically (see Bamforth and Grund, 2012  and  Contreras and Meadows, 2014 ; Rhode et al., in press), would allow us to explore in greater depth the problem of equifinality that exists between real demographic structures and impostors.
5. Conclusion

The MC simulation framework presented in this paper is intended to build on the precedent of these past studies, first by automating the simulation algorithm and thereby allowing for larger and more robust simulations, and second by allowing the researcher to experimentally manipulate the many parameters that influence tfd s. To illustrate the power of this approach, I chose to evaluate the impact of sample size and TFD shape on spd structure, holding other parameters of the system constant. This experiment reveals a more nuanced interaction between calibration and stochastic processes than previously articulated: calibration interference expresses itself as a time-dependent fluctuation in the degree of inter-run variability. The stochastic processes, on the other hand, determine the direction and degree of such variability. Several solutions, including sample size increase, a focus on the least variable temporal intervals, and kernel density estimation, may be effective in mitigating these problems, although the last solution awaits further exploration. Future work is also warranted to explore the impacts of other parameters of the model system (chiefly instrument error and TFD scale and location) on the structure of 14 C spd s.

    In the dTFA literature, the term ‘cumulative probability distribution/function’ has occasionally been used in place of ‘summed probability distribution/function.’ This usage is unfavorable, having the potential to be confused with either of two standard statistical terms – ‘(cumulative) density function’ (df or cdf, expressed F ( x ) in mathematical notation) and ‘cumulative probability function’ – referring to the probability Pr ( X  ≤  x ) for continuous and discrete variates, respectively.

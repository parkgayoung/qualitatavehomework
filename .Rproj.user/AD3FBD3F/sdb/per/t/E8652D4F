The three primary models to explain the transition are: 1) a slow in situ evolutionary model, where indigenous foragers slowly developed blade and microblade technologies with little to no outside influences; 2) a north-south [migration] model, where migrations from the north by blade and microblade utilizing foraging groups and from the south by traditional core and flake utilizing foragers occurred; and 3) a migration/trade interaction model where migrations occurred from the north, possibly from the south, but at least some of the foragers in the region interacted in some type of trade interaction sphere. These models are reviewed here, along with a presentation of key Korean sites that date to the MIS 3?2 transition.},\n\turldate = {2015-06-03},\n\tjournal = {Quaternary International},\n\tauthor = {Bae, Christopher J. and Bae, Kidong},\n\tmonth = dec,\n\tyear = {2012},\n\tpages = {26--35},\n\tfile = {ScienceDirect Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\8X4KVKSV\\\\Bae ?????????

The blade toolkits were introduced, but did not immediately replace coexisting simplified forms of tools. Simple core and flake tool assemblages (SCFA) were dominant, and were maintained without any positive cultural or technological modifications during this period of time.\n\nRevolutionary appearances of behavioral modernity did not occur during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic period. Efficient behavioral innovations rapidly extending across the peninsula occurred only after that period of time. The blades seem not to be regarded truly as a technological marker which normally replaced preexisting simple stone tools; the advantages of SCFA, which comprise of agile and expedient toolkits, played a key role. This implies that the Korean Mode 4 assemblage during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic does not truly represent a technocomplex breakthrough.\n\nThe puzzling lack of more standardized tools should be viewed not as a conventional cultural tradition. More diverse transmitted elements for interpreting the preferences for expedient tools among forager groups may be required.},\n\turldate = {2015-06-03},\n\tjournal = {Quaternary International},\n\tauthor = {Lee, Hyeong Woo},\n\tmonth = dec,\n\tyear = {2013},\n\tpages = {45--58},\n\tfile = {ScienceDirect Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\2EIR66K2\\\\Lee - 2013 - Current observations of the early Late Paleolithic.pdf:application/pdf;ScienceDirect Snapshot:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\Q8RBQ4V3\\\\S1040618213001584.html:text/html}\n}\n\n@article{seong_emergence_2009,\n\ttitle = {Emergence of a {Blade} {Industry} and {Evolution} of {Late} {Paleolithic} {Technology} in the {Republic} of {Korea}},\n\tvolume = {65},\n\tcopyright = {Copyright ? 2009 University of New Mexico},\n\tissn = {0091-7710},\n\turl = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/25608225},\n\tabstract = {The origin and spread of behavioral modernity has been one of the most hotly debated paleoanthropological issues during the past two decades or so. Researchers have examined changes in technology, subsistence, and social organization. The Upper (Late) Paleolithic is traditionally characterized by the establishment of a blade industry. Patterns of lithic technology closely reflect settlement and subsistence systems, and any change can be explained in terms of interplay among various factors, including technological constraints, raw material availability, mobility, and extended social networks in changing environments. A recent increase in archaeological excavations and advances in chronology allow us to discuss Late Pleistocene cultural evolution in Korea in more detail. Two notable, seemingly contradictory features during the early Late Paleolithic are recognized: (1) some lithic assemblages are characterized by small flake artifacts made of local quartzite and vein quartz, and (2) other assemblages include new artifact types?blades and tanged points?manufactured with hitherto largely unused fine-grained materials. Late Paleolithic technological characteristics emerged ca. 40,000-30,000 BP, but not until the onset of the OIS 2 did formal artifacts, such as blades and blade tools, became predominant in lithic assemblages. This change is viewed as a slow, evolutionary process that eventually culminated in the Late Paleolithic transition.},\n\tnumber = {3},\n\turldate = {2015-06-03},\n\tjournal = {Journal of Anthropological Research},\n\tauthor = {Seong, Chuntaek},\n\tmonth = oct,\n\tyear = {2009},\n\tpages = {417--451},\n\tfile = {JSTOR Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\37D7WGQM\\\\Seong - 2009 - Emergence of a Blade Industry and Evolution of Lat.pdf:application/pdf}\n}\n\n@article{bae_origin_2010,\n\tseries = {Hominin {Morphological} and {Behavioral} {Variation} in {Eastern} {Asia} and {Australasia}: {Current} {Perspectives}},\n\ttitle = {Origin and patterns of the {Upper} {Paleolithic} industries in the {Korean} {Peninsula} and movement of modern humans in {East} {Asia}},\n\tvolume = {211},\n\tissn = {1040-6182},\n\turl = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618209001852},\n\tdoi = {10.1016/j.quaint.2009.06.011},\n\tabstract = {Assemblages classified as ?Upper Paleolithic? in the Korean peninsula are diverse in their composition, including not only some blade industries but also conventional ones continued from earlier Paleolithic periods. This has often been explained as the result of an indigenous development. However, the ?heterogenic? character of Upper Paleolithic industries is the result of the continuing influx of modern human populations via two different routes: (1) from Siberia and (2) from southern China. Blade technology from Siberia appeared in the Korean peninsula around 35???000 BP and coexisted with core and flake stone industries carried by modern humans from southern China and Southeast Asia throughout the Upper Paleolithic. This explanation is based on the current observation of patterns of Upper Paleolithic industries in East Asia. Blade industries have been found only in the northern part of East Asia while none have been reported in southern China, although modern Homo evidently dispersed via two different routes from the Near East. The ?North-South Model? of Modern Homo migrations into the Korean peninsula is supported by a genetic analysis of the Y-chromosome of the modern population in this region. Continuing influx of modern human population from both origins to the peninsula can explain the consistent presence of Upper Paleolithic industries that appear heterogenic.},\n\tnumber = {1?2},\n\turldate = {2015-06-04},\n\tjournal = {Quaternary International},\n\tauthor = {Bae, Kidong},\n\tmonth = jan,\n\tyear = {2010},\n\tpages = {103--112},\n\tfile = {ScienceDirect Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\BIIUIS7M\\\\Bae - 2010 - Origin and patterns of the Upper Paleolithic indus.pdf:application/pdf;ScienceDirect Snapshot:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\7ZE35N5G\\\\S1040618209001852.html:text/html}\n}\n\n@article{binford_preliminary_1966,\n\ttitle = {A {Preliminary} {Analysis} of {Functional} {Variability} in the {Mousterian} of {Levallois} {Facies}},\n\tvolume = {68},\n\tcopyright = {1966 American Anthropological Association},\n\tissn = {1548-1433},\n\turl = {http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/doi/10.1525/aa.1966.68.2.02a001030/abstract},\n\tdoi = {10.1525/aa.1966.68.2.02a001030},\n\tlanguage = {en},\n\tnumber = {2},\n\turldate = {2015-06-06},\n\tjournal = {American Anthropologist},\n\tauthor = {Binford, Lewis R. and Binford, Sally R.},\n\tmonth = apr,\n\tyear = {1966},\n\tpages = {238--295},\n\tfile = {Full Text PDF:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2nmcq3af.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\EQGJR9QJ\\\\Binford ?????????

Against realism he argues that the central aim of science is empirical adequacy, and that the only belief involved in the acceptance of a scientific theory is belief that the theory fits the observable phenomena. To substatiate this, the book presents three mutually supporting theories concerning science. The first is an account of the relation between a scientific theory and the empirical world. The second is a new theory of explanation and why-questions, according to which the explanatory power of a theory is a pragmatic aspect which goes beyond its empirical import, but which provides no additional reasons for believing it. And the third is an interpretation of probability in physical theory, with reference to both classical and quantum physics. The presentation of these three central theses is preceded by two chapters which provide an informal introduction to current debates in the philosophy of science, particularly concerning scientific realism.},\n\tlanguage = {en},\n\tpublisher = {Clarendon Press},\n\tauthor = {Fraassen, Bas C.
